# Fast Protocol Economics & MEV Distribution Model

This document provides a technical, implementation-oriented explanation of how **FAST RPC**, **mev-commit**, and the **Fast Protocol** collectively capture, route, and redistribute mev. It aims to give engineers, integrators, and validators a clear understanding of the value flows, incentive design, and equilibrium properties of the system.

## Overview of Fast Protocol

FAST RPC adds an **order flow auction (OFA)** on top of **mev-commit**. When users send transactions through FAST RPC:

- The RPC auctions and simulates backruns
- Extractable MEV is realized through backrun bundles
- Builders commit via mev-commit’s **decaying bid** mechanism
- A portion of the mev goes to validators, depending on opt-in status
- The rest flows into the **mev distribution contracts**, forming the basis of tokenized mev rewards

The system ensures:

- Users receive **≥90%** of the mev their transactions generate when feasible
- Opted-in validators earn **significantly more** mev than non-opted-in validators
- The protocol achieves a **unique equilibrium** where no competing OFA can sustainably pay users more

## Mev Flow & Core Definitions

### Mev Components

For each mev-commit bundle:

```math
M_{bundle} = M_{bid} + M_{priority} + M_{direct}
