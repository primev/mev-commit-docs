## Eigenlayer Restaking Option

If you plan to bulk opt-in a large number of validators, check out the [Eigenlayer Operator Registration](/v0.8.0/knowledge-base/eigenlayer-operator-registration) guide.

Otherwise, individual validator entities (represented by a pod owner) can delegate to an existing registered Operator.

A native-restaking enabled validator opting in to mev-commit requires two high level steps:

1. The validator's pod owner must delegate (via eigenlayer core) their native stake to an Operator who's registered with the mev-commit AVS. For Holesky, these can be found on the mev-commit AVS [Eigenlayer dashboard](https://holesky.eigenlayer.xyz/avs/0xededb8ed37a43fd399108a44646b85b780d85dd4). Mainnet link coming soon. If your existing delegated operator is not registered with mev-commit, you have the option to [change your delegation](https://docs.eigenlayer.xyz/eigenlayer/restaking-guides/restaking-user-guide/restaker-delegation/redelegation-process).
2. The validator must separately be *registered* with the mev-commit AVS, confirming their attestation to follow the relay selection rule mentioned above.

Step 2 will be facilitated the [validator dashboard](https://validators.mev-commit.xyz/dashboard) interface to the `MevCommitAVS.registerValidatorsByPodOwners` function.

Note the connected metamask account must be the delegated operator, or pod owner, of the validators that are being registered.
