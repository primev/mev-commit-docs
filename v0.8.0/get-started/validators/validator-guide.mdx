## Why Participate?

Participation of L1 validators in the mev-commit protocol is crucial as it enhances the integrity of commitments and ensures their enforcement.

## Supported Networks

Both Holesky and Mainnet L1 validators are able to opt-in to mev-commit. The opt-in process is initiated from the chain the validator is staked on.

See [mainnet](/v0.8.0/developers/mainnet#l1-validator-registries) and [testnet](/v0.8.0/developers/testnet#validator-registry-contract-addresses-holesky) for relevant contract addresses.

## Requirements

1. An operational L1 validator node for either mainnet or Holesky.
2. An operational mev-boost sidecar.
3. Capital requirements as described further below.

<Warning>
As a validator opting into the mev-commit protocol, ensure your mev-boost client only connects to mev-commit opted-in relays to avoid slashing for proposing blocks without delivering commitments.
</Warning>

By opting-in to the mev-commit protocol as a validator **in any of the three forms described**, you agree to only use **opted-in relays**. These opted-in relays will only forward mev-boost bids from addresses that have registered with the mev-commit provider registry, such that any provider can be slashed in case of a protocol violation. This allows validators to passively opt-in to mev-commit, letting block builders and relays do the work.

**Supporting Relays:**  

| Relay | Docs |
|-------|------|
| Titan | [docs.titanrelay.xyz](https://docs.titanrelay.xyz/) |
| Aestus| [holesky.aestus.live](https://holesky.aestus.live/) |

We expect all known relays to support opting-in to mev-commit within a few months of being live on mainnet. If you are a relay looking to join the mev-commit network please visit our [Relays page](/v0.8.0/get-started/relays) to get more information.

Proposers who fallback to local block production, from either a fault in the mev-boost software or a lack of economically viable block bids, **will not be slashed**. See [flashbots docs](https://docs.flashbots.net/flashbots-mev-boost/architecture-overview/risks#liveness-and-local-fallback) for more on this scenario. The protocol may in the future slash for abuse of this local fallback mechanism.

## Protocol Design

To learn more about the protocol design for any of the registries, see their respective READMEs:

* [MevCommitMiddleware](https://github.com/primev/mev-commit/tree/main/contracts/contracts/validator-registry/middleware#readme)
* [MevCommitAVS](https://github.com/primev/mev-commit/blob/main/contracts/contracts/validator-registry/avs/README.md)
* [VanillaRegistry](https://github.com/primev/mev-commit/tree/main/contracts/contracts/validator-registry#vanilla-registry---simple-staking-solution)

To query the on-chain parameters of any registry (on mainnet or Holesky), run an example forge script like [this](https://github.com/primev/mev-commit/blob/main/contracts/scripts/validator-registry/GetParams.s.sol).
