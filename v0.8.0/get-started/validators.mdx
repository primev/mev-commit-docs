## Why is validator participation important to mev-commit?

Participation of L1 validators in the mev-commit protocol is crucial as it enhances the integrity of commitments and ensures their enforcement.

## Supported Networks

Both Holesky and Mainnet L1 validators are able to opt-in to mev-commit. The opt-in process is initiated from the chain the validator is staked on.

See [mainnet](/v0.8.0/developers/mainnet#l1-validator-registries) and [testnet](/v0.8.0/developers/testnet#validator-registry-contract-addresses-holesky) for relevant contract addresses.

## Requirements

1. An operational L1 validator node for either mainnet or Holesky.
2. An operational mev-boost sidecar.
3. Capital requirements as described further below.

<Warning>
As a validator opting into the mev-commit protocol, ensure your mev-boost client only connects to mev-commit opted-in relays to avoid slashing for proposing blocks without delivering commitments.
</Warning>

By opting-in to the mev-commit protocol as a validator **in any of the three forms described**, you agree to only use **opted-in relays**. These opted-in relays will only forward mev-boost bids from addresses that have registered with the mev-commit provider registry, such that any provider can be slashed in case of a protocol violation. This allows validators to passively opt-in to mev-commit, letting block builders and relays do the work.

**Supporting Relays:**  

| Relay | Docs |
|-------|------|
| Titan | [docs.titanrelay.xyz](https://docs.titanrelay.xyz/) |
| Aestus| [holesky.aestus.live](https://holesky.aestus.live/) |

We expect all known relays to support opting-in to mev-commit within a few months of being live on mainnet. If you are a relay looking to join the mev-commit network please visit our [Relays page](/v0.8.0/get-started/relays) to get more information.

Proposers who fallback to local block production, from either a fault in the mev-boost software or a lack of economically viable block bids, **will not be slashed**. See [flashbots docs](https://docs.flashbots.net/flashbots-mev-boost/architecture-overview/risks#liveness-and-local-fallback) for more on this scenario. The protocol may in the future slash for abuse of this local fallback mechanism.

    ## Eigenlayer Restaking Option

    If you plan to bulk opt-in a large number of validators, check out the [Eigenlayer Operator Registration](/v0.8.0/knowledge-base/eigenlayer-operator-registration) guide.

    Otherwise, individual validator entities (represented by a pod owner) can delegate to an existing registered Operator.

    A native-restaking enabled validator opting in to mev-commit requires two high level steps:

    1. The validator's pod owner must delegate (via eigenlayer core) their native stake to an Operator who's registered with the mev-commit AVS. For Holesky, these can be found on the mev-commit AVS [Eigenlayer dashboard](https://holesky.eigenlayer.xyz/avs/0xededb8ed37a43fd399108a44646b85b780d85dd4). Mainnet link coming soon. If your existing delegated operator is not registered with mev-commit, you have the option to [change your delegation](https://docs.eigenlayer.xyz/eigenlayer/restaking-guides/restaking-user-guide/restaker-delegation/redelegation-process).
    2. The validator must separately be *registered* with the mev-commit AVS, confirming their attestation to follow the relay selection rule mentioned above.

    Step 2 will be facilitated the [validator dashboard](https://validators.mev-commit.xyz/dashboard) interface to the `MevCommitAVS.registerValidatorsByPodOwners` function. Note the connected metamask account must be the delegated operator, or pod owner, of the validators that are being registered.

    ## Symbiotic Restaking Option

    This method of validator opt-in is currently being audited and will be available here shortly. Refer to [repo](https://github.com/primev/mev-commit/blob/main/contracts/contracts/validator-registry/middleware/README.md).
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Simple Staking">
    ## Simple Staking Option

    Validators are able to _opt-in to mev-commit_ by _vanilla_ staking ETH directly with the `vanillaRegistry` contract. This stake is separate from a validator's 32 ETH already staked with the beacon chain.

    The registry strictly accepts BLS public keys as the validator opt-in identifier. Any EOA can stake on behalf of a validator pub key, and only that EOA has the ability to withdraw in the future.

    <Warning>
    EOAs must only register pubkeys for which they control or otherwise manage. If an EOA registers a pubkey for which they do not own/manage (think “griefing”), the relevant stake amount may be slashed.
    </Warning>

    The `minStake` parameter represents how much ETH must be staked per validator pubkey to define that validator as opted-in to mev-commit. On mainnet, `minStake` is 1 ETH, while on Holesky it's 0.0001 ETH.

    <Note> For large groups of validators, it is recommended to stake in batches of 10-20 public keys at a time to ensure transaction success without hitting gas limits. This process can be tested on Holesky. </Note>
    
    ### Staking Your Validator Keys

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Visit the Validator Dashboard">
        - Navigate to mev-commit [Validator Dashboard](https://validators.mev-commit.xyz/).
        - Press the "Opt-in to mev-commit" button to connect your wallet.

        </Frame>
      </Step>

      <Step title="Acquire Testnet ETH">   
        - Ensure that you have at least `minStake` amount of ETH per validator pubkey to stake.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Stake Your Validator Keys"> 
        - Click the Stake(lock icon) button on the top right of the dashboard to initiate staking.
        - You can either upload a .txt file containing your keys separated by commas or line breaks, or you can copy and right-click paste the keys directly into the field provided.

        <Frame>
          <img src="/v0.8.0/images/upload-keys.gif" />
        </Frame>
      </Step>

      <Step title="Enter Stake Amounts">  
        - Enter the amount of ETH you wish to stake for each key.
        - Press "Stake" and confirm the transaction on your wallet to finalize the staking of your keys.

        <Frame>
          <img src="/v0.8.0/images/stake.gif" />
        </Frame>
      </Step>

      <Step title="Manage Your Staked Keys"> 
        - After staking, you can view your staked keys by clicking on "Manage Stake".
        - To unstake your keys, you can multi-select the keys or use the meatball(3-dots) menu to unstake them.
        - After unstaking, you will need to wait for the unstaking period to pass before you can withdraw your ETH. The required waiting period will be displayed for each key on the "Withdraw" column.

## Protocol Design

To learn more about the protocol design for any of the registries, see their respective READMEs:

* [VanillaRegistry](https://github.com/primev/mev-commit/tree/main/contracts/contracts/validator-registry#vanilla-registry---simple-staking-solution)
* [MevCommitMiddleware](https://github.com/primev/mev-commit/tree/main/contracts/contracts/validator-registry/middleware#readme)
* [MevCommitAVS](https://github.com/primev/mev-commit/blob/main/contracts/contracts/validator-registry/avs/README.md)

To query the on-chain parameters of any registry (on mainnet or Holesky), run an example forge script like [this](https://github.com/primev/mev-commit/blob/main/contracts/scripts/validator-registry/GetParams.s.sol).
