### **Debugging Tools in mev-commit Node**

As the mev-commit node is under active development, it includes debugging tools for in-depth analysis.
These tools, primarily intended for developers and not for everyday users, offer insights into the node's functionality.
They are accessible via the HTTP API endpoint.

### **Understanding Network Topology**

You can view the network's topology as recognized by the mev-commit node at the `/v1/debug/topology` endpoint.
This provides information such as the number of connected nodes and their roles, helping to ensure your node is well-connected within the network.

Example of Topology Data:

```json
{
  "self": {
    "Addresses": ["/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/13522", "/ip4/172.29.18.2/tcp/13522"],
    "Ethereum Address": "0xB8c29FfD307067471fd7997873DfC496Fd02956f",
    "Peer Type": "bootnode",
    "Underlay": "16Uiu2HAmLYUvthfDCewNMdfPhrVefBbsfaPL22fWWfC2zuoh5SpV"
  },
  "connected_peers": {
    "bidders": ["0xb9286cb4782e43a202bfd426abb72c8cb34f886c"]
  },
  "blocked_peers": [
    {
      "Peer": "0x48ddc642514370bdafad81c91e23759b0302c915",
      "Reason": "insufficient stake",
      "Duration": "1m58.244219375s"
    }
  ]
}
```

### **Prometheus Metrics for Monitoring**

The node emits various Prometheus metrics, which can be utilized to create dashboards displaying the node's statistics.
These include default metrics from the `libp2p` networking library and are available at the `/metrics` endpoint.

### **Pprof Endpoints**

For advanced users, pprof endpoints are available at `/debug/pprof` for performance profiling, such as monitoring memory and CPU usage.
However, understanding and using these endpoints requires prior knowledge of pprof tools and is not covered in this documentation.
