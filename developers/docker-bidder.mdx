# **Docker Container for Bidder Node**

The MEV-Commit Bidder setup leverages Docker to deploy a bidder node service within a single container, the repository [can be found here](https://github.com/primev/bidder_node_docker) . This bidder node connects to the MEV-Commit testnet, enabling users to submit bids seamlessly. 
By containerizing the service, you ensure a consistent and reproducible environment, simplifying deployment and scaling.

# Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- Docker: Install Docker on your machine. You can download it from the official Docker website.
- Docker Compose: Ensure Docker Compose is installed. It typically comes bundled with Docker Desktop, but you can verify by running docker-compose --version.
- Afunded MEV-Commit address.
- A valid Holesky private key for authentication. If you need funds, use the MEV-Commit [faucet](https://faucet.testnet.mev-commit.xyz/).

                                                                                                 
# Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to set up and run your MEV-Commit bidder node.

1. Clone the Repository
Begin by cloning the repository to your local machine:

```bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/mev-commit-bidder-docker.git
cd mev-commit-bidder-docker```
                                                                                                 
2. Configure Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory of the repository to store your environment variables securely.

Create the .env file:

```bash
Copy code
touch .env```
Define the required variables:

Open the .env file in your preferred text editor and add the following:

```env
Copy code
PRIVATE_KEY_BIDDER=your_private_key_here
DOMAIN=testnet.mev-commit.xyz
```
Replace your_private_key_here with your actual private key.
The DOMAIN variable defaults to testnet.mev-commit.xyz, but you can modify it if needed.
3. Build and Run Docker Containers
With the environment configured, proceed to build and run the Docker containers.

# Build and start the services:

```bash
Copy code
docker-compose up --build```
This command performs the following actions:

Builds the Docker image based on Ubuntu 20.04.
Installs necessary dependencies such as curl and jq.
Downloads and installs the latest MEV-Commit binary from the official repository.
Starts the bidder node service within the container.

# Access the Service:

Once the container is running, your bidder node should be operational and connected to the MEV-Commit testnet. You can begin submitting bids through the network.

# Customization
Tailor the bidder node to fit your specific needs by adjusting environment variables or modifying the startup script.

# Environment Variables
You can customize several environment variables to configure the bidder node:

PRIVATE_KEY_BIDDER: Your private key for authenticating the node with the testnet.
DOMAIN: The MEV-Commit testnet domain. Defaults to testnet.mev-commit.xyz.
To modify these variables, update the .env file accordingly:

```env
Copy code
PRIVATE_KEY_BIDDER=your_new_private_key
DOMAIN=custom-domain.mev-commit.xyz```

# Modifying the Entry Point
The container uses an entrypoint.sh script to initiate the bidder service. If you need to alter the startup sequence:

Edit the entrypoint.sh script:

Locate and open the entrypoint.sh file in the repository. Make your desired changes to customize the startup behavior.

Rebuild the Docker Image:

After modifying the script, rebuild the Docker image to apply the changes:

```bash
Copy code
docker-compose up --build```
                                                                                                 
# Networking with Other Repositories
Integrate the MEV-Commit bidder node with other Docker services to create a cohesive application ecosystem.

Why a Docker Network Is Needed
A shared Docker network allows multiple containers to communicate seamlessly using container names instead of hardcoded IP addresses. This setup is essential for services like bidding scripts or Geth containers to interact with the MEV-Commit bidder node.

Creating the Network
Before deploying your containers, create a shared Docker network:

```bash
Copy code
docker network create app-network```
                                                                                                 
This network, named app-network, facilitates communication between the bidder node and other services.

# Using the Network with Other Containers
To enable other Docker services to communicate with the MEV-Commit bidder node, ensure they reference the same app-network. Here's how to configure another repository's docker-compose.yml to join the network:

```yaml
Copy code
version: '3'
services:
  bid-sender:
    image: your-bid-sender-image
    networks:
      - app-network
    environment:
      - RPC_ENDPOINT=http://mev-commit-bidder:13524

networks:
  app-network:
    external: true
```
