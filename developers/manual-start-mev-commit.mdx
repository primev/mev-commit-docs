Below, you'll find a guide tailored for those who prefer a more customized installation approach.

<Steps titleSize="h3">

  <Step title="Install cast">
  
  We use the [cast](https://book.getfoundry.sh/cast/) CLI tool for making Ethereum RPC calls.
  If it's not already installed on your system, you can set up the entire Foundry toolchain, including `cast`, with the following command:

    ```bash ‚ùØ_ terminal
    curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
    ```

    After installation, execute `foundryup` to update to the latest versions of Foundry's suite of tools:
     `forge`, `cast`, `anvil`, and `chisel`:


    ```bash ‚ùØ_ terminal
    foundryup
    ```

    For detailed guidance, refer to the official [Foundry Book](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) installation instructions.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Check your CPU architecture">

    Run the following command which will identify your OS, and chip architecture:

    ```bash  ‚ùØ_ terminal
    uname -sm
    ```

    This command will output something like `Linux x86_64` or `Darwin arm64`, depending on your system.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Get the mev-commit binary">

    Navigate to the [mev-commit repo](https://github.com/primev/mev-commit/releases/latest)
    and select the mev-commit binary tailored to your system.
    For example, if `uname -sm` yields `Linux x86_64`, opt for `mev-commit_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz`.
    Download, then extract the binary into your preferred root directory to continue with setup.

    You can use the following command which automatically downloads and extracts the appropriate
    mev-commit binary for your system into your home directory:

    ```bash  ‚ùØ_ terminal
    FILENAME="mev-commit_$(uname -s)_$(uname -m).tar.gz"
    curl -L \
    "https://github.com/primev/mev-commit/releases/download/v0.5.0/$FILENAME" \
    | tar -xz -C $HOME
    ```

    <Accordion title="üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Recommended: Verify the checksum">

    Before executing any code downloaded from the internet, it's recommended to verify the checksum,
    a practice that ensures the file's integrity and authenticity. Checksums, provided with each release on GitHub,
    serve as a safeguard, allowing you to confirm that the downloaded binary has not been compromised or altered,
    thus protecting your system from potential security risks.

    To verify the checksum of the mev-commit binary, you can follow these simplified steps (assumes binary is the home directory):

    <Steps>

      <Step title="Grab the checksum">

        Set the binary's name based on your system and retrieve the corresponding checksum:

        ```bash ‚ùØ_ terminal
        FILENAME="mev-commit_$(uname -s)_$(uname -m).tar.gz"
        CHECKSUM=$(curl -L \
        "https://github.com/primev/mev-commit/releases/download/v0.5.0/mev-commit_v0.5.0_checksums.txt" \
        | awk "/$FILENAME/ {print \$1}")
        ```
      </Step>

      <Step title="Verify">

        Verify the binary's checksum by running the following:

        <CodeGroup>

        ```bash linux
        echo "$CHECKSUM $HOME/$FILENAME" | sha256sum -c -
        ```

        ```bash macOs (Darwin)
        echo "$CHECKSUM $HOME/$FILENAME" | shasum -a 256 -c -
        ```

        </CodeGroup>

       ‚úÖ **Success**

        If the output resembles the following, you may confidently proceed to the next steps:

        ```bash ‚ùØ_ bidder
        filename.tar.gz: OK
        ```

        ‚ùå **Failure**

        Should the output indicate a failure, as shown below, re-download the file and attempt verification once more.

        ```bash
        filename.tar.gz: FAILED
        shasum: WARNING: 1 computed checksum did NOT match
        ```

        If checksum verification continues to fail after multiple attempts, reach out to Primev for support.

## Starting up your Node

Execute the script to initiate your node, selecting either a bidder or provider configuration based on your role in the network.

<CodeGroup>

```bash ‚ùØ_ bidder
mev-commit --keystore-path ~/.mev-commit \
 --keystore-password <PASSWORD> \
	--bootnodes /dnsaddr/bootnode.testnet.mev-commit.xyz \
	--settlement-rpc-endpoint https://chainrpc.testnet.mev-commit.xyz
```

```bash ‚ùØ_ provider
mev-commit --peer-type provider --keystore-path ~/.mev-commit \
 --keystore-password <PASSWORD> \
	--bootnodes /dnsaddr/bootnode.testnet.mev-commit.xyz \
	--settlement-rpc-endpoint https://chainrpc.testnet.mev-commit.xyz
```

</CodeGroup>

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <div className="inline-card-header">
    <Card title="Bidders" icon="user-bounty-hunter">
      <br />
      <br />
      Once the node is started you can go through the [funding
      process](/get-started/bidders/fund-node) to start sending bids.
    </Card>
  </div>
  <div className="inline-card-header">
    <Card title="Providers" icon="network-wired">
      <br />
      <br />
      In order to register as a provider please go through the [registration
      process](/get-started/providers/registering-a-provider).
    </Card>
  </div>
</CardGroup>

- `--bootnodes` This should point to the bootnode for the Primev testnet network.
- `--settlement-rpc-endpoint` This should point to the Primev Settlement Chain RPC endpoint. At present this is managed by the Primev team.

‚ùó By default, the node is started as a `Bidder` node. The `--peer-type` flag can be used to run a different type of node. This will most likely be the `provider` node.

‚ùó The default contract addresses point to the Primev testnet at the moment. All the options can be provided using a YAML config file or environment variables as described in the above help output.

‚ùó The mev-commit node, when started for the first time will create a private key for the node at `~/.mev-commit/key`. This is a plain-text key. In order to store encrypted keys, users need to use the keystore. This can be configured using the `--keystore-path` and `--keystore-password`.
