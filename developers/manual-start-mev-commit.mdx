## Bidder Manual Start

This section is for users who prefer a more hands-on approach to setting up mev-commit.
It allows for customization and a better understanding of the setup process.

**Pre-requisites:**

- `curl`: A command-line tool used for downloading files from the internet.
- `terminal`: A command-line interface for executing commands.
- `cast`: A command-line tool for Ethereum blockchain interaction. Install it using the following command:

```bash ❯_ terminal
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

After installing `cast`, run `foundryup` to ensure it's updated.

#### Running the Bidder Node

- **Step 1. Check your CPU architecture:**

  ```bash ❯_ terminal
  uname # This will give you the OS type
  uname -m # This will give you the chip architecture
  ```

- **Step 2. Pull The Required Binary of mev-commit based on your CPU architecture.**

  Download the binaries from the following:

  https://github.com/primevprotocol/mev-commit/releases/tag/v0.2.0

  Unzip the binary and store it in a root directory of your choice.

- **Step 3. Place the binary, named mev-commit, into a folder of your choice.**

  Note this will be considered the root folder of your mev-commit.

- **Step 4. Run the initialization**

  cd into the folder that contains the mev-commit binary and run the following command:

  ```bash ❯_ terminal
  ./mev-commit init --dir . --rpc-endpoint https://chainrpc.testnet.mev-commit.xyz  --peer-type bidder
  ```

  This will create both a private key file and a config.yaml file and store it in your current directory.

  While in the directory, run the following command to export relevant data about your address and private key:

  ```bash ❯_ terminal
  export KEY=$(cat key)
  export ADDRESS=$(cast wallet address --private-key 0x$(cat key))
  ```

- **Step 5. Fund the account**

  cd to the folder where you’ve stored the key and run the following command to transfer 100 ether into your wallet from a faucet account:

  ❗If you’ve named the private key file something other than key, change the key to the correct name in \`--private-key 0x$(cat \*\*\*key\*\*\*))\`

```bash ❯_ terminal
 cast send \
 --rpc-url https://chainrpc.testnet.mev-commit.xyz \
 --private-key 0x7c9bf0f015874594d321c1c01ada3166c3509bbd91f76f9e4d7380c2df269c55 $(cast wallet address --private-key 0x$(cat key)) \
 --value 100ether
```

- **Step 6. Run the node**

  1. cd into the folder with your mev-commit binary
  2. Run the Node:

  ```bash ❯_ terminal
  ./mev-commit start --config=~/config.yaml
  ```

- **Step 7. Prepay for bids**

  The bidder needs to prepay a certain amount onto the Primev contracts to allow them to send bids and receive commitments. This is to ensure that providers can pull funds once the bids have been completed.

  To prepay, first **open a new terminal** and run the following command:

  ```bash ❯_ terminal
  curl -X POST http://localhost:13523/v1/bidder/provide_allowance/1000000000000000000
  ```

  This will prepay `1000000000000000000 wei` into your account.

## Provider Manual Start

Provider Manual Start is tailored for users who prefer a more hands-on approach, offering greater control over the setup process and the ability to customize configurations.

**Pre-requisites:**

- `curl`: Ensure this command-line tool is installed for file downloads.
- `terminal`: Used for executing all the commands.
- `cast`: A tool for Ethereum blockchain interactions. Install it by running

```bash ❯_ terminal
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

- Then execute `foundryup` to complete the setup
- **Step 1. Check your CPU architecture**

  ```bash ❯_ terminal
  uname # This will give you the OS type
  uname -m # This will give you the chip architecture
  ```

- **Step 2. Pull The Required Binary of mev-commit based on your CPU architecture**

  Download the binaries from the following

  https://github.com/primevprotocol/mev-commit/releases/tag/v0.2.0

- **Step 3. Place the binary, named mev-commit, into a folder of your choice**

  Note this will be considered the root folder of your mev-commit

- **Step 4. Run the initialization**

  cd into the folder that contains the mev-commit binary and run the following command

  ```bash ❯_ terminal
  ./mev-commit init --dir . --rpc-endpoint https://chainrpc.testnet.mev-commit.xyz  --peer-type provider
  ```

  This will create both a private key file and a config.yaml file and store it in your current directory.

  While in the directory, run the following command to export relevant data about your address and private key:

  ```bash ❯_ terminal
  export KEY=$(cat key)
  export ADDRESS=$(cast wallet address --private-key 0x$(cat key))
  ```

- **Step 5. Fund the account**

  cd to the folder where you’ve stored the key and run the following command to transfer 100 ether into your wallet from a faucet account:

  ❗If you’ve named the private key file something other than key, change the key to the correct name in `--private-key 0x$(cat key)`

  ```bash ❯_ terminal
  cast send --rpc-url https://chainrpc.testnet.mev-commit.xyz \
  --private-key 0x7c9bf0f015874594d321c1c01ada3166c3509bbd91f76f9e4d7380c2df269c55 $(cast wallet address --private-key 0x$(cat key)) \
  --value 100ether
  ```

- **Step 6. Run the node**

  1. cd into the folder with your mev-commit binary
  2. Run the Node:

  ```bash ❯_ terminal
  ./mev-commit start --config=~/config.yaml
  ```

- **Step 7. Stake Funds and Register**

  This command is used to ensure that your provider has been registered with a stake in our protocol.
  This is used to ensure it can connect with the mev-commit-p2p network. Ensure you run this command in the mev-commit directory.

  ```bash ❯_ terminal
  cast send 0x5960774AD41D03DAB4916a30bD2190f8b3b3b4b2 "registerAndStake()" $(cast wallet address --private-key 0x$(cat key)) \
  --rpc-url https://chainrpc.testnet.mev-commit.xyz --private-key $(cat key) --value 100ether
  ```
