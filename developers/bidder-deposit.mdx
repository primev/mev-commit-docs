        ]
      },
      "blocked_peers": null
    }
    ```

To add funds to your account on the mev-commit chain, you may use the [testnet faucet](http://faucet.testnet.mev-commit.xyz/). 


- **Adding to Your Deposit:**

To increase your deposit for the current window, use the following command, specifying the desired amount:

```shell
> curl -X POST localhost/v1/bidder/deposit/YOUR_AMOUNT | jq
```

To increase your deposit for the specific window, use the following command, specifying the desired amount and window number:

```shell
> curl -X POST "localhost/v1/bidder/deposit/YOUR_AMOUNT" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "window_number": 1
  }' | jq
```

To increase your deposit for the specific L1 block number, use the following command, specifying the desired amount and L1 block number:

```shell
> curl -X POST "localhost/v1/bidder/deposit/YOUR_AMOUNT" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "block_number": 1,
  }' | jq
```
After successfully adding to your deposit, you are ready to send bids and receive preconfirmations on the network.

- **Withdrawing from Your Deposit:**

To withdraw funds from your deposit, use the following command:

```shell
> curl -X POST localhost/v1/bidder/withdraw \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "window_number": 1
  }' | jq
```
If you don't specify a window number, the current window will be used by default.

### Outcome of Preconfirmed Bids:
When a bid is preconfirmed by a provider, there are several possible outcomes:

| Outcome Matrix | Provider Wins Slot Auction| Provider Loses Slot Auction |
| --------------------- | --------------| --------|
| **Transaction in block**                   | Reward Provider          | Refund Bid to Bidder  |
| **Transaction not in block**                 | Slash Provider & Refund Bid To Bidder           | Refund Bid to Bidder  |
