# Contribution Guidelines
Welcome to our documentation, we are glad to have you here!

This repository contains the source code for our documentation website. If you'd like to contribute, please follow these guidelines:

1. Fork the repository and create a new branch from the `main` branch.
2. Make your changes to the markdown files.
3. Submit a pull request to the `main` branch.

## Standards and conventions

### Links
- Ensure all links that reference the documentation are linking using an absolute path. For example, to reference fund node page, you do as follows: `[fund node](/get-started/bidders/fund-node)`.

### New Files
- Ensure all files are in lowercase.
- Ensure all files are using kebab-case. For example, the kebab-case version of "My First Preconf" is "my-first-preconf.mdx".

We'd appreciate if you would run mintlify dev to verify changes locally and mintlify broken-links to ensure there aren't any broken links introduced from your changes. Thank you! :)
