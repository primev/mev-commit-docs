The mev-commit system enforces execution guarantees by default. 
This means that transactions must be executed successfully to ensure providers aren't slashed. 
We allow users to specify which transactions are critical and must succeed, and which can revert.

This is important because providers, in most cases, can provide inclusion guarantees with little cost. 
For example, if a block builder has gas left in the block, they can trivially include any preconfirmed transaction at the bottom of the block.
