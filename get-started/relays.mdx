Relays play an important role in the mev-commit ecosystem to uphold validator commitments. Validators are passively opting in to the network, and configuring their mev-boost relays to the ones that have opted in to mev-commit.

Opting into mev-commit as a relay means that you sign up to deliver mev-boost bids only from builder addresses that have registered with mev-commit. This is necessary as it acts as a sybil resistance mechanism, disallowing block builders from making commitments but building a block under a different builder key that mev-commit would not be able to penalize. In this context, 'filtering' refers to the relay's role in screening and validating builder addresses, ensuring that only those registered with mev-commit are allowed to submit bids, following the protocol.

Information about the providers (entities like builders who commit on our network) is stored the provider registry hosted on the mev-commit chain. You can interact with the registry at the contract address at {ProviderRegistryAddress}.

  <Accordion title="How to retrieve all connected providers">
    You can retrieve all connected providers using the following script:

    ```javascript
    // Import the ethers library
    const ethers = require("ethers");

    // Define the provider using the RPC URL
    const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider("https://chainrpc.testnet.mev-commit.xyz/");

    // Define the contract address and ABI
    const providerRegistryAddress = "0x4FC9b98e1A0Ff10de4c2cf294656854F1d5B207D";
    const abi = [
        "event ProviderRegistered(address indexed provider, uint256 stakedAmount)"
    ];

    // Create a new contract instance
    const contract = new ethers.Contract(providerRegistryAddress, abi, provider);

    // Function to retrieve the list of registered providers
    async function getRegisteredProviders() {
        // Create a filter for the ProviderRegistered event
        const filter = contract.filters.ProviderRegistered();

        // Query the contract for the ProviderRegistered events
        const events = await contract.queryFilter(filter);

        // Map the events to get the list of provider addresses
        const providers = events.map(event => event.args.provider);

        return providers;
    }

    // Call the function and log the result
    getRegisteredProviders().then(providers => {
        console.log("Registered Providers:", providers);
    }).catch(error => {
        console.error("Error:", error);
    });
    ```

  <Accordion title="Expected Output">
    The output will be a list of addresses that have registered with mev-commit.

Relays need to look out for mev-commit opted-in proposer addresses, and only deliver block builder bids from builder addresses that are registered with mev-commit when it's that proposer's turn. See [Querying for Proposers](/get-started/providers/Querying-for-proposers) to see how you can check whether an upcoming proposer is opted in to mev-commit or not.

Once you've configured your relay to deliver blocks with mev-commit commitments, create a PR to this [docs repo](https://github.com/primev/mev-commit-docs/blob/main/get-started/validators.mdx) to add your relay to the supporting relays list. This will let validators know that they can add your relay as they opt-in to mev-commit. You should also let the Primev team know so we can further engage with validators to make sure they use your relay as well.
