## Interacting with the Bidder Node

<Note>Ensure you have completed the [Quickstart](/get-started/quickstart) step in a separate terminal. This will set up your environment and place your key in the `$HOME/.mev-commit` directory, along with running the required bidder node.</Note>

Now that you've made sure we have a bidder node running, we can interact with it using the following commands:

```shell ❯_ terminal
cd $HOME/.mev-commit;
export KEY=$(cat key);
export ADDRESS=$(cast wallet address --private-key 0x$(cat key))
```

## Getting Deposit

To get the current deposit balance in the contract for the current [window](/concepts/bids/bidder-deposit):

```shell ❯_ terminal
curl -s http://localhost:13523/v1/bidder/get_deposit
```

To get the current deposit balance in the contract for a specific [window](/concepts/bids/bidder-deposit):

```shell ❯_ terminal
curl -s http://localhost:13523/v1/bidder/get_deposit?windowNumber=1
```

<Tip>Deposit represents the funds in the bidder's account that can be used to submit bids on the mev-commit p2p-network and settled on-chain.</Tip>

## Withdraw Deposited Funds

This command will allow you to withdraw funds from the specific [window](/concepts/bids/bidder-deposit). 
Window number is the number where the bidder deposited funds.

```shell ❯_ terminal
curl -X POST http://localhost:13523/v1/bidder/withdraw?windowNumber=1 \
```

## Autodeposit Funds

The auto deposit feature allows you to automate the process of depositing funds for the bidder account. This is useful for ensuring your bidder account always has funds available to bid. In order to achieve this, the node will keep issuing deposits for the new windows and also withdrawing funds from the previous windows.

<Note> For seamless availability of funds, the deposits would be locked for around 3 windows at a time. So the total amount locked would be `3 * amountPerWindow`. The user's wallet should have enough funds to be able to maintain these deposits as well as cover gas costs to issue transactions.</Note>

There are two ways to enable this feature:

### On node boot up

Users can use the command-line or the configuration file to enable this feature on node boot-up. The `autodeposit-enabled` flag should be set as well as the `autodeposit-amount` needs to be set to the amount to be deposited in each window.

<Note> In order to enable this at node boot up, users needs to fund their wallet before starting the node. So we would need to know the private-key used for the account beforehand. </Note>

```shell ❯_ terminal
mev-commit --keystore-path ~/.mev-commit \
 --keystore-password <PASSWORD> \
	--bootnodes /dnsaddr/bootnode.testnet.mev-commit.xyz \
	--settlement-rpc-endpoint https://chainrpc.testnet.mev-commit.xyz
  --autodeposit-enabled true
  --autodeposit-amount 1000000000000000000
```

### Use the Bidder API

Another option to enable this is using the Bidder API.

```shell ❯_ terminal
curl -X POST http://localhost:13523/v1/bidder/auto_deposit?amount=1000000000000000000
```

## Get Auto Deposit Status

To get the status of the auto deposit process:

```shell ❯_ terminal
curl -s http://localhost:13523/v1/bidder/auto_deposit_status
```

## Cancel Auto Deposit

To cancel the auto deposit process:

```shell ❯_ terminal
curl -X POST http://localhost:13523/v1/bidder/cancel_auto_deposit?withdraw=true
```

This will stop the ongoing auto deposit process.

<Note> If withdraw is set, the node will try to withdraw the deposit at the earliest possible time. It might take time before we are able to withdraw from the current window. The bidder node should be running in order to allow this process to complete. If withdraw is not set, the API will return the window numbers which have been already deposited to. The user can then manually issue withdraw at a later point using the API. </Note>

## Withdraw Funds

To withdraw funds from the several windows, you can use the following command:

```shell ❯_ terminal
curl -X POST http://localhost:13523/v1/bidder/withdraw_from_windows \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"windowNumbers": [1, 2, 3]}'
```

## Checking the Balance of your Wallet

This command will allow you to check your current wallet balance on mev-commit chain:

```shell ❯_ terminal
cast b $ADDRESS --rpc-url https://chainrpc.testnet.mev-commit.xyz
```

## Check Total Value Locked in Contracts

```shell ❯_ terminal
python3 -c "print($(cast b 0x7ffa86fF89489Bca72Fec2a978e33f9870B2Bd25 \
--rpc-url https://chainrpc.testnet.mev-commit.xyz) + $(cast b 0x4FC9b98e1A0Ff10de4c2cf294656854F1d5B207D \
--rpc-url https://chainrpc.testnet.mev-commit.xyz))"
```

## Topology

```shell ❯_ terminal
curl http://localhost:13523/v1/debug/topology
```

## Validator API

To enable this API, the following environment variables should be set when launching a bidder client:

- `MEV_COMMIT_VALIDATOR_ROUTER_ADDR`
- `MEV_COMMIT_BEACON_API_URL`
- `MEV_COMMIT_L1_RPC_URL`

Current address for the validator router contract is `0xF3e5E8eB71f821D299EFf0E826a50A95589eD043`.

URLs for the beacon chain and L1 RPC are `https://ethereum-holesky-beacon-api.publicnode.com` and `https://ethereum-holesky-rpc.publicnode.com` respectively.

To get the information on whether validators for a specific epoch are opted in to mev-commit:

```shell ❯_ terminal
curl http://localhost:13523/v1/validator/get_validators?epoch=1
```

To get the information on whether validators for a latest epoch are opted in to mev-commit:

```shell ❯_ terminal
curl http://localhost:13523/v1/validator/get_validators
```

## Configuring custom provider sets

Users can also set-up a specific subset of provider nodes in order to send their bids. By default the mev-commit bidder node will send bids to all the available and staked providers. However, if the user wants only a specific subset of providers to be able to see their bids, the can use the `--provider-whitelist` option to set it up. The list should contain the ethereum wallet addresses of the provider nodes.

```shell ❯_ terminal
mev-commit --keystore-path ~/.mev-commit \
 --keystore-password <PASSWORD> \
	--bootnodes /dnsaddr/bootnode.testnet.mev-commit.xyz \
	--settlement-rpc-endpoint https://chainrpc.testnet.mev-commit.xyz
  --provider-whitelist 0x6DcE7bcF4fCA9E14b546e583049B82474631b185,0x0979c194EaD08444B6e40415F5822AB32363f580
```
