## Interacting with the Bidder Node

<Note>Ensure you have completed the [Quickstart](/get-started/quickstart) step in a separate terminal. This will set up your environment and place your key in the `$HOME/.mev-commit` directory, along with running the required bidder node.</Note>

Now that you've made sure we have a bidder node running, we can interact with it using the following commands:

```shell ‚ùØ_ terminal
cd $HOME/.mev-commit;
export KEY=$(cat key);
export ADDRESS=$(cast wallet address --private-key 0x$(cat key))
```

## Getting Deposit

To get the current deposit balance in the contract for the current [window](https://docs.primev.xyz/concepts/bidder-deposit):

```shell ‚ùØ_ terminal
curl -s http://localhost:13523/v1/bidder/get_deposit
```

To get the current deposit balance in the contract for a specific [window](https://docs.primev.xyz/concepts/bidder-deposit):

```shell ‚ùØ_ terminal
curl -s http://localhost:13523/v1/bidder/get_deposit?windowNumber=1
```

üí°Deposit represents the funds in the bidder's account that can be used to submit bids on the mev-commit p2p-network and settled on-chain.

## Withdraw Deposited Funds

This command will allow you to withdraw funds from the specific [window](https://docs.primev.xyz/concepts/bidder-deposit). 
Window number is the number where the bidder deposited funds.

```shell ‚ùØ_ terminal
curl -X POST http://localhost:13523/v1/bidder/withdraw?windowNumber=1 \
```

## Autodeposit Funds

The auto deposit feature allows you to automate the process of depositing funds for multiple windows ahead. This is useful for ensuring your bidder account always has funds available for future windows.

Autodeposit will split the initial deposit amount across the specified number of windows. The deposit amount is the total amount to be deposited across all windows. Currently default amount of windows is 3.

By setting up auto deposit, you can deposit funds for a specific window and automate the process for subsequent windows, reducing the need for manual intervention.

The withdrawal functionality allows you to withdraw deposited funds from specific windows. This can be useful if you need to reclaim funds that were previously deposited.

## Start Auto Deposit

To start the auto deposit process:

```shell ‚ùØ_ terminal
curl -X POST http://localhost:13523/v1/bidder/auto_deposit \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "amount": "1000000000000000000",
        "windowNumber": 3
      }'
```

## Get Auto Deposit Status

To get the status of the auto deposit process:

```shell ‚ùØ_ terminal
curl -s http://localhost:13523/v1/bidder/auto_deposit_status
```

## Cancel Auto Deposit

To cancel the auto deposit process:

```shell ‚ùØ_ terminal
curl -X POST http://localhost:13523/v1/bidder/cancel_auto_deposit
```

This will stop the ongoing auto deposit process.

## Cancel And Withdraw Auto Deposit

To cancel the auto deposit process and withdraw the funds:

```shell ‚ùØ_ terminal
curl -X POST http://localhost:13523/v1/bidder/cancel_and_withdraw_auto_deposit
```

This will stop the ongoing auto deposit process and withdraw the funds deposited for the current windows.

The funds will be withdrawn when the current window is greater than the last window for which funds were deposited.

## Withdraw Funds

To withdraw funds from the several windows, you can use the following command:

```shell ‚ùØ_ terminal
curl -X POST http://localhost:13523/v1/bidder/withdraw_from_specific_windows
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
          "windows": [1, 2, 3]
        }'
```

## Checking the Balance of your Wallet

This command will allow you to check your current wallet balance on mev-commit chain:

```shell ‚ùØ_ terminal
cast b $ADDRESS --rpc-url https://chainrpc.testnet.mev-commit.xyz
```

## Check Total Value Locked in Contracts

```shell ‚ùØ_ terminal
python3 -c "print($(cast b 0x7ffa86fF89489Bca72Fec2a978e33f9870B2Bd25 \
--rpc-url https://chainrpc.testnet.mev-commit.xyz) + $(cast b 0x4FC9b98e1A0Ff10de4c2cf294656854F1d5B207D \
--rpc-url https://chainrpc.testnet.mev-commit.xyz))"
```
