### Submit Bundles
To include bundles of transactions, submit them in the exact atomic sequence they appear in the bundle. Bundles can be submitted as either:
* An array of transaction hashes.
* An array of transaction payloads.

Submitting raw transaction payloads is more efficient for providers, as it eliminates the extra step of looking up the payload based on a transaction hash when matching transactions with preconfirmation bids. This allows providers to be able to send preconfirmation commitments back to the bidder faster as well. 

Bidders will start receiving commitments instantly in most cases. If you're having trouble receiving commitments, check your bid parameters and ensure your bid is high enough for the commitment you're requesting. Additionally check that you are connected to providers (via the [topology endpoint](https://docs.primev.xyz/get-started/bidders/bidder-node-commands#topology)) and that you are receiving mev-commit events (via the [health endpoint](https://docs.primev.xyz/get-started/bidders/bidder-node-commands#health)).

#### Transaction Hash
```shell ❯_ example
curl -X POST http://localhost:13523/v1/bidder/bid \
-d '{
    "txHashes": ["0549fc7c57fffbdbfb2cf9d5e0de165fc68dadb5c27c42fdad0bdf506f4eacae", "22145ba31366d29a893ae3ffbc95c36c06e8819a289ac588594c9512d0a99810", "7e1506f266bc86c81ae46018053a274a3bd96a9eff17392930707bf8fa5ff6be"],
    "amount": "<amount in wei>",
    "blockNumber": <integer l1blocknumber>,
    "decayStartTimestamp": <timestamp milliseconds>,
    "decayEndTimestamp": <timestamp milliseconds>,
    "revertingTxHashes": ["22145ba31366d29a893ae3ffbc95c36c06e8819a289ac588594c9512d0a99810"]
}'
```  
You can change the values in the fields `txHashes`, `amount`, `blockNumber`, `decayStartTimestamp`, `decayEndTimestamp` and `revertingTxHashes` as desired.

#### Transaction Payload
Similarly if you are including the raw transaction payloads, they need to be in the atomic sequence in which they need to be placed in the block.

```shell ❯_ example
curl -X POST http://localhost:13523/v1/bidder/bid \
-d '{
    "rawTransactions": ["0x02f8db82426882010c8410433624841043362f8303425094ea593b730d745fb5fe01b6d20e6603915252c6bf87016e03ce313800b864ce0b63ce0000000000000000000000000e94804eaa3c4c5355992086647f683f6f41ef1f000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000150e0786cc000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000004e378c001a0ece6d13b20247abdc07d669c9186ee5a1ac9601db8c98a3323024ab299cb6662a01c20680efe4e0bb48a3a936b5ab27c741819f0ac567b12b34b230004b20b78a0", "0x02f8748242682c841043362684104336318252089412b141665da4a5f617c759ad996ef91ad806a9c0880de0b6b3a764000080c001a0806552ed846808580eb896994825f07e73de2f42e2d3554f228284ecfaa89d9ca046d58b62ba565982fb07a64b436dd7a6c210b2f59c4fb2aee2cdd150ccf8bfaa"],
    "amount": "<amount in wei>",
    "blockNumber": <integer l1blocknumber>,
    "decayStartTimestamp": <timestamp milliseconds>,
    "decayEndTimestamp": <timestamp milliseconds>,
    "revertingTxHashes": ["7ca16add2aa1b1ef718006b791cb48a6ad729d22f5d2a0b294705320e4825abb"]
}'

## Provider RPCs

Below is a table of Provider RPCs to send your transactions to. You may already be sending transactions to these providers if you have existing transaction operations. To check which providers you are connected to, you can use the [topology endpoint](https://docs.primev.xyz/get-started/bidders/bidder-node-commands#topology).

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width="350">Provider</th>
      <th width="350">RPC Endpoint</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Preconf Builder</td>
      <td>[http://52.11.201.67:8545/](http://52.11.201.67:8545/)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

## Bidder Funds

Bidders on mev-commit need funds available in their account to submit bids, which can be obtained via bridging to your wallet address and then depositing to your node address. For testnet, you can obtain funds by using the [faucet](https://faucet.testnet.mev-commit.xyz/).

### Depositing For Bid Windows

To submit bids, you need to have a deposit in your bidder account. After completing Quickstart and using `launchmevcommit` to start your bidder node, [autodeposit](https://docs.primev.xyz/get-started/bidders/bidder-node-commands#autodeposit-funds) should be enabled by default. 
This will automatically deposit funds into your account for the next 3 [windows](/concepts/bids/bidder-deposit) to bid. 
A window is the number of L1 blocks in the round (for L1, it’s 10 blocks) during which the bidder can post bids. Unused funds will automatically transfer into upcoming windows for bidding.

If you want to check your autodeposit status, run the following command:

```shell ❯_ terminal
curl -s http://localhost:13523/v1/bidder/auto_deposit_status
```

<Accordion title="Understanding Credible and General Commitments">
  <p>In the context of the mev-commit network, commitments play a crucial role in the bidding process. You can receive <strong>credible</strong> and <strong>general</strong> commitments; if the proposer for the slot is opted-in to mev-commit, provider commitments are ultimately credible.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Credible Commitments:</strong> These are guarantees provided by actors within the network that have complete control over the fullfilment or delivery of your bid, this could be a block builder, proposer, or a sequencer.</p>
  
  <p><strong>General Commitments:</strong> These commitments are also promises made by network participants but with a lower level of assurance compared to credible commitments. These can be used to have similar guarantees as credible commitments if aggregated among a range of providers, e.g. all block builders submitting mev-boost bids for a mev-boost enabled validator.</p>  
  
  <p>As a bidder, understanding the difference between these two types of commitments will help you maximize your utility from the network.</p>
