You're ready to start submitting bids to the network once you've completed [Quickstart](/get=started/Quickstart) and funded your bidder node wallet.
Make sure to verify that your bidder node is connected to at least one provider node, which can be confirmed via the [localhost:13523/topology](http://localhost:13523/topology) endpoint.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Deposit For Bids">

To submit bids, you need to have a deposit in your bidder account. After using `launchmevcommit` to start your bidder node, [autodeposit](https://docs.primev.xyz/get-started/bidders/bidder-node-commands#autodeposit-funds) should be enabled by default. 
This will automatically deposit funds into your account. At that point, you will have 1 ETH deposited for the next 4 [windows](/concepts/bids/bidder-deposit) to bid. 
A window is the number of L1 blocks in the round (for L1, it’s 10 blocks) during which the bidder can post bids. 
If you want to check your autodeposit status, run the following command:

```shell ❯_ terminal
curl -s http://localhost:13523/v1/bidder/auto_deposit_status
```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Sending Bids">
    Open a new terminal window. To send bids, we simply run the following command:

```shell ❯_ example
curl -X POST http://localhost:13523/v1/bidder/bid \
-d '{
    "txHashes": ["0549fc7c57fffbdbfb2cf9d5e0de165fc68dadb5c27c42fdad0bdf506f4eacae"],
    "amount": "<amount in wei>",
    "blockNumber": <integer l1blocknumber>,
    "decayStartTimestamp": <timestamp milliseconds>,
    "decayEndTimestamp": <timestamp milliseconds>,
    "revertingTxHashes": []
}'
```

<Warning>Make sure your bid amount is sufficiently high for the commitment you're requesting, and your target L1 block number is accurate. It's up to the providers to commit to your bid, so try to ensure a commitment is feasible to your bid by its construction.</Warning>

        | `blockNumber`  | L1 block number targeted for bid inclusion |
        | `decayStartTimestamp` | Start timestamp for bid decay (in Unix milliseconds) |
        | `decayEndTimestamp` | End timestamp for bid decay (in Unix milliseconds) |
        | `revertingTxHashes` | Array of transaction hashes as strings that can revert |

    </Accordion>

To include bundles of transactions, add them in the atomic sequence in which they exist in the bundle, as follows:

```shell ❯_ example
curl -X POST http://localhost:13523/v1/bidder/bid \
-d '{
    "txHashes": ["0549fc7c57fffbdbfb2cf9d5e0de165fc68dadb5c27c42fdad0bdf506f4eacae", "22145ba31366d29a893ae3ffbc95c36c06e8819a289ac588594c9512d0a99810", "7e1506f266bc86c81ae46018053a274a3bd96a9eff17392930707bf8fa5ff6be"],
    "amount": "<amount in wei>",
    "blockNumber": <integer l1blocknumber>,
    "decayStartTimestamp": <timestamp milliseconds>,
    "decayEndTimestamp": <timestamp milliseconds>,
    "revertingTxHashes": ["22145ba31366d29a893ae3ffbc95c36c06e8819a289ac588594c9512d0a99810"]
}'
```  
<Tip>You can change the values in the fields txHashes, amount, blockNumber, decayStartTimestamp and decayEndTimestamp as desired.</Tip>
