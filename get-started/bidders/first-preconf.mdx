Once you've funded your bidder node wallet, you're ready to start submitting bids to the network.
It's crucial to verify that your bidder node is connected to at least one provider node.
This connectivity can be confirmed via the [localhost:13523/topology](http://localhost:13523/topology) endpoint.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Deposit For Bids">
    Run this command to load your account with funds to start bidding:

```shell ❯_ terminal
curl -X POST http://localhost:13523/v1/bidder/deposit/1000000000000000000
```

This tops up your account with `1000000000000000000 wei` (1 ETH) for the current [window](/concepts/bids/bidder-deposit), ensuring you're all set to send bids!
The window is the number of L1 blocks in the round for which the bidder can post bids.

If you want to deposit funds for a specific L1 block number, which will be automatically converted to the corresponding window, use the following command:

```shell ❯_ terminal
curl -X POST "http://localhost:13523/v1/bidder/deposit/1000000000000000000?block_number=<block_number>"
```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Sending Bids">
    Open a new terminal window. To send bids, we simply run the following command:

```shell ❯_ example
curl -X POST http://localhost:13523/v1/bidder/bid \
-d '{
    "txHashes": ["0549fc7c57fffbdbfb2cf9d5e0de165fc68dadb5c27c42fdad0bdf506f4eacae"],
    "amount": "<amount in wei>",
    "blockNumber": <integer l1blocknumber>,
    "decayStartTimestamp": <timestamp>,
    "decayEndTimestamp": <timestamp>
}'
```

<Warning>Make sure your bid amount is sufficiently high for the commitment you're requesting, and your target L1 block number is accurate. It's up to the providers to commit to your bid, so try to ensure a commitment is feasible to your bid by its construction.</Warning>

To include bundles of transactions, add them in the atomic sequence in which they exist in the bundle, as follows:

```shell ❯_ example
curl -X POST http://localhost:13523/v1/bidder/bid \
-d '{
    "txHashes": ["0549fc7c57fffbdbfb2cf9d5e0de165fc68dadb5c27c42fdad0bdf506f4eacae", 22145ba31366d29a893ae3ffbc95c36c06e8819a289ac588594c9512d0a99810, 7e1506f266bc86c81ae46018053a274a3bd96a9eff17392930707bf8fa5ff6be],
    "amount": "<amount in wei>",
    "blockNumber": <integer l1blocknumber>,
    "decayStartTimestamp": <timestamp>,
    "decayEndTimestamp": <timestamp>
}'
```  
<Tip>You can change the values in the fields txHashes, amount, blockNumber, decayStartTimestamp and decayEndTimestamp as desired.</Tip>
