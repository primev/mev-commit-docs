Providers that have registered in the mev-commit registry will automatically start receiving bids on the mev-commit p2p network from bidders. In order to see incoming bids, providers need to communicate with their mev-commit node:

Use the official go RPC client to communicate with your mev-commit node. Go get the mev-commit package and then import the generated client as below:

<Steps>

 <Step title="Install the mev-commit package">

  ```bash ‚ùØ_ terminal
  go install github.com/primev/mev-commit@latest
  ```
 </Step>
  <Step title="Incorporate the generated client into your Go application as follows">

  ```go
  import providerapiv1 "github.com/primev/mev-commit/p2p/gen/go/providerapi/v1"
  
  conn, err = grpc.DialContext(
  	context.Background(),
  	"localhost:13524",
  	grpc.WithBlock(),
  	grpc.WithTransportCredentials(insecure.NewCredentials()),
  )

  if err != nil {
  	// handle error
  }

  client := providerapiv1.NewProviderClient(conn)

  bidStream, err := client.ReceiveBids(context.Background(), &providerapiv1.EmptyMessage{})
  if err != nil {
  	// handle error
  }

  bidC := make(chan *providerapiv1.Bid)
  go func() {
  	defer close(bidC)
  	for {
  		bid, err := bidStream.Recv()
  		if err != nil {
  			// handle error
  		}
  		select {
  		case <-bidStream.Context().Done():
  		case bidC <- bid:
  		}
  	}
  }()

  stream, err := client.SendProcessedBids(context.Background())
  if err != nil {
  	// handle error
  }

  for bid := range bidS {
  	// check the bid details and communicate with the block-building
  	// infrastructure to make a decision
  	status := getDecision(bid)

  	err := stream.Send(&providerapiv1.BidResponse{
  			BidDigest: bid.BidDigest,
  			Status:    status,
  	})
  	if err != nil {
  		// handle error
  	}
  }
  ```

  There is an [example implementation](https://github.com/primev/mev-commit/tree/main/p2p/examples/provideremulator) of a dummy provider client which blindly accepts all the bids it sees from its mev-commit node. This could be a good starting point for providers implementing their commitment decision logic in golang.

### Alternative Methods

1. Use [https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl](https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl) or [https://github.com/bloomrpc/bloomrpc](https://github.com/bloomrpc/bloomrpc) or other GUI clients like [Postman](https://www.postman.com). Relevant protobuf files are available in the [mev-commit repository](https://github.com/primev/mev-commit).
2. Check the [API docs](/api-reference/introduction) to use the REST APIs. The RPC APIs are also available on the HTTP server.
3. Users can use the protobuf files to generate a client in language of their choice.
