To send your first commitment, you will need to connect to the mev-commit Testnet.
This will allow you to consume bids incoming to the network and submit commitments.
Your first step is to set up a provider node. The following command will allow you to automatically set up a full provider mev-commit node:

```
curl -L -o launchmevcommit launch.mev-commit.xyz && chmod +x launchmevcommit && ./launchmevcommit --node-type provider
```

Now you'll want to connect a decisioning system that will accept and reject bids based on custom criteria. You can read more about the API to open a gRPC stream [here](/api-reference/provider/sendprocessedbids).

If you want to get started quickly with a dummy emulator, you can open a new terminal and run the following command:

<Warning>You require Go Version 1.21.1 to run the example emulator</Warning>
``` 
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/primev/mev-commit.git && cd mev-commit &&
git checkout v0.3.0 && cd p2p/examples/provideremulator && go run . 
```

## Configuring custom logic to process bids and send Commitments

We can take a deeper look at how you can add custom logic to decision on the sending of commitments.

### Integrating Bid Processing in Your System

To integrate bid processing in your system using the Provider API, follow these steps to receive bid information and send back processed bids:

#### 1. Implement the gRPC Service

Implement the Provider service as outlined in the [providerapi.proto](https://github.com/primev/mev-commit/blob/main/p2p/rpc/providerapi/v1/providerapi.proto#L20). This requires setting up a server that can manage RPC methods, with a particular emphasis on the reception of bids and response of commitment authorizations.

#### 2. Receive Bids

Utilize the ReceiveBids RPC method to listen for incoming bids from clients. This method streams bid messages to your server.
The structure of the bid is as follows:

```proto
message Bid {
  option (grpc.gateway.protoc_gen_openapiv2.options.openapiv2_schema) = {
    json_schema: {
      title: "Bid message"
      description: "Signed bid message from bidders to the provider."
      required: ["txHashes", "bidAmount", "blockNumber", "bidDigest"]
    }
    example: "{"bidDigest": "9dJinwL+FZ6B1xsIQQo8t8B0ZXJubJwY86l/Yu7yAH159QrPHU0qj2P+YFj+llbuI1ZygdxGsX8+P3byMEA5ig==", "status": "STATUS_ACCEPTED"}"
  };
  repeated string tx_hashes = 1;
  string bid_amount = 2;
  int64 block_number = 3;
  bytes bid_digest = 4;
  int64 decay_start_timestamp = 5;
  int64 decay_end_timestamp = 6;
};
```

Below is an image of the flow through which bids would be received through the gRPC API

#### 3. Process Bids

For each received bid, implement your custom logic to validate and process these bids. This could involve checking the bid's validity and feasibility based on orderflow, computing the effective gas price, and deciding whether to accept or reject the bid.

#### 4. Send Processed Bid Responses (Accept/Reject)

After processing each bid, construct a BidResponse message indicating the outcome. This message should include the bid's digest and a status indicating acceptance or rejection.
At a high level, to commit to a bid, your code must send a `STATUS_ACCEPTED` with the bid digest specified, and correspondingly `STATUS_REJECTED` to reject the bid.

<Accordion title="Details on BidResponse">
The BidResponse structure is as follows:
```
message BidResponse {
  option (grpc.gateway.protoc_gen_openapiv2.options.openapiv2_schema) = {
    json_schema: {
      title: "Bid response"
      description: "Response sent by the provider with the decision on the bid received."
      required: ["bidDigest", "status"]
    }
    example: "{\"bidDigest\": \"9dJinwL+FZ6B1xsIQQo8t8B0ZXJubJwY86l/Yu7yAH159QrPHU0qj2P+YFj+llbuI1ZygdxGsX8+P3byMEA5ig==\", \"status\": \"STATUS_ACCEPTED\"}"
  };
  bytes bid_digest = 1 [(grpc.gateway.protoc_gen_openapiv2.options.openapiv2_field) = {
    description: "Digest of the bid message signed by the bidder."
  }];
  enum Status {
    STATUS_UNSPECIFIED = 0;
    STATUS_ACCEPTED = 1;
    STATUS_REJECTED = 2;
  }
  Status status = 2 [(grpc.gateway.protoc_gen_openapiv2.options.openapiv2_field) = {
    description: "Status of the bid."
  }, (buf.validate.field).enum = {
      defined_only: true,
      in: [
        1,
        2
      ]
  }];
  int64 dispatch_timestamp = 3;
};
```

It contains the following fields:

1. bid_digest: A byte array (bytes type) that represents the digest of the bid message signed by the bidder. This serves as a unique identifier for the bid in question.
2. status: An enumeration (enum Status) that indicates the status of the bid. The status can be one of three values:
   STATUS_UNSPECIFIED: The default value, indicating that the status has not been set or is unknown.
   STATUS_ACCEPTED: Indicates that the bid has been accepted by the provider.
   STATUS_REJECTED: Indicates that the bid has been rejected by the provider.
3. dispatch_timestamp: Timestamp (int64 type) at which the commitment is accepted by provider and is used to compute the expected revenue from the preconfirmation.
  </Accordion>

#### 5. Server Setup

Deploy your gRPC server on suitable infrastructure, ensuring it's accessible to clients. Configure necessary network settings for security and connectivity.
Example Server Implementation in Go:

```go

import (
	...

	"github.com/primev/mev-commit/p2p/examples/provideremulator/client"
	providerapiv1 "github.com/primev/mev-commit/p2p/gen/go/providerapi/v1"
)

func ...() {
	...

	providerClient, _ := client.NewProviderClient(*serverAddr, logger)

	bidS, _ := providerClient.ReceiveBids()

	for {
		select {
		case bid, more := <-bidS:
			if !more {
				return
			}
			logger.Info("received new bid", "bid", bid)
			_ := providerClient.SendBidResponse(context.Background(), &providerapiv1.BidResponse{
				BidDigest: bid.BidDigest,
				Status:    providerapiv1.BidResponse_STATUS_ACCEPTED, // decide here if you want to accept or reject
        DispatchTimestamp: time.Now().Unix(),
			})
		}
	}
}
```

This should help you integrate bid processing into your system, allowing for the reception of bid information and sending back processed bids as commitments.
