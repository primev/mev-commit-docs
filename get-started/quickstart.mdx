```shell
curl -o launchmevcommit https://raw.githubusercontent.com/primevprotocol/scripts/v0.1.0/launchmevcommit && \
chmod +x launchmevcommit && \
./launchmevcommit --rpc-url https://chainrpc.testnet.mev-commit.xyz --node-type bidder
```

This will get you going with a mev-commit node as a bidder on the network. To join the network as a **provider**, simply change the "--node-type bidder" to "--node-type provider". Next, dive into the [bidder](https://docs.primev.xyz/get-started/bidders/fund-node) or [provider](https://docs.primev.xyz/get-started/providers/register-a-provider) sections to run your operations on the network.

**Pre-requisites:**

- Ensure you have `curl` installed on your system. `curl` is a command-line tool used to transfer data from or to a server.
- A `terminal` to execute the command. This can be any command-line interface like Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS, or a Linux shell.

❗You will need to have a public IP and expose the peer-to-peer port 13522 on your local machine to allow the provider node to establish connections that are incoming to the node.

**This command performs several actions automatically:**

- Downloads the mev-commit startup script using `curl`.
- Makes the script executable with `chmod`.
- Executes the script to set up mev-commit with the required configurations.

Your mev-commit node setup is done once the command execution is complete.

If you want to perform a manual setup with detailed steps please skip to [manual start mev-commit](https://docs.primev.xyz/developers/manual-start-mev-commit) section.
