# Quickstart

Ready to get your node up and running? This streamlined process will guide you through launching either a bidder or provider node in the Primev network.

<Steps titleSize="h3">
  <Step title="üì• Download">

    Start by downloading the latest setup script from our repository.

    ```bash ‚ùØ_ terminal
    curl -o launchmevcommit \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/primevprotocol/scripts/main/launchmevcommit
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="üõ†Ô∏è Permission">

    Ensure the script is executable with the following command:

    ```bash ‚ùØ_ terminal
    chmod +x launchmevcommit
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="üöÄ Launch">

    Execute the script to initiate your node, selecting either a bidder or provider configuration based on your role in the network.

    <CodeGroup>

        ```bash ‚ùØ_ bidder
        ./launchmevcommit --node-type bidder
        ```

        ```bash ‚ùØ_ provider
        ./launchmevcommit --node-type provider
        ```

    </CodeGroup>

    <Note>
      You need to make sure that the peer-to-peer port 13522 on your local machine is accessible through a public IP address.
      This setup enables the provider node to initiate incoming connections to your node.
    </Note>

  </Step>

    ## Script Overview

    This script automates the setup and initialization of your Primev node, catering to both bidder and provider roles. Below is a detailed breakdown of the script's operations:

    ### 1. Initialization
    - Sets up essential variables like the RPC URL (`https://chainrpc.testnet.mev-commit.xyz) for network communication and the node type (either `bidder` or `provider`).
    - Establishes the root directory (`$HOME/.mev-commit`) where the mev-commit node will be installed.

    ### 2. Download
    - Fetches the appropriate mev-commit binary for your system from the [Primev GitHub releases page](https://github.com/primevprotocol/mev-commit/releases/latest), considering your operating system and architecture.

    ### 3. Installation
    - Extracts the downloaded binary into the specified root directory, ensuring all necessary executables are correctly placed for the node's operation.

    ### 4. Configuration
    - Initializes the mev-commit node with your specified settings, including the node type and the RPC endpoint, along with necessary contract addresses for the node's functionality.

    ### 5. Wallet Setup
    - Generates a new private key and wallet address for your node and secures it with test ether to facilitate transactions within the testnet environment.

    ### 6. Node Startup
    - Launches the mev-commit node in the background tailored to the specified role, enabling it to begin its operations within the Primev network.

    ### 7. Cleanup
    - Includes a cleanup function to ensure the node is properly shut down when the script exits, preventing any residual processes.
