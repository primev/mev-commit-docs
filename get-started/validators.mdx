## Opting-in as a Validator

Participation of L1 validators in the mev-commit protocol is crucial as it enhances the integrity of commitments and ensures their enforcement. This document details the steps required to join the mev-commit testnet as a Holesky validator. Future updates will introduce a restaking feature via Eigenlayer.

**Prerequisites:**

1. An operational Holesky validator node. 
2. An operational mev-boost sidecar or equivalent.
3. Associated validator key(s).

<Warning>As a Holesky validator opting into the mev-commit protocol, ensure your mev-boost client connects only to mev-commit relays to avoid slashing for proposing blocks without delivering commitments.</Warning>

### Requirements

By opting-in to the mev-commit protocol as a Holesky validator, you agree to the following:

* Your mev-boost client should ONLY connect to mev-commit opted in relays to avoid being slashed by proposing a block that doesn't deliver commitments. The Titan Holesky relay is the only supporting relay at this time as shown in the list below. This list will be updated as more relays support the network.  
  
**Supporting Relays:**
