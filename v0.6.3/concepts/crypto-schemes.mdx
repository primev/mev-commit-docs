### Signature Schemes

We implement ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) keys for our signature process.
Additionally, our messages are formatted using EIP-712 standards, enhancing human readability and structured data representation.
The ECDSA framework enables the recovery of both the public key and the signer's address through the ECRecover function, which are native to Geth.

### Hashing

Our system employs keccak256 (SHA-3) for hashing, aligning with EVM standards for optimal interoperability.
This is useful for interoperability with the EVM, as it natively supports keccak256 through pre-compiles,
both on L1 Ethereum and our mev-commit chain.
