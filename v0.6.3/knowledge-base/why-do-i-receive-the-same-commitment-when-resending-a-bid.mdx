description: "Understand why resending a bid in the mev-commit ecosystem results in receiving the same commitment."
---

When you resend a bid within the mev-commit ecosystem, receiving the same commitment back is a direct result of
the deterministic nature of the underlying cryptographic mechanisms, specifically hashes and the Elliptic Curve
Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA). These mechanisms ensure that for a given set of inputs, the output will always be the same.

This means that if the bid's payload (the data contained within the bid) and the bidder's private key do not
change between submissions, and the provider's private key remains constant, the resulting commitment will be
identical for each submission of the bid. This deterministic behavior is crucial for maintaining consistency
and integrity in the bidding process, ensuring that each bid is uniquely tied to its specific data and the identities of the involved parties.

## What is this needed?

This feature of cryptographic schemes like ECDSA provides a layer of security and predictability, ensuring
that bids cannot be tampered with or falsely represented without the private keys. It also simplifies the
process of verifying and accepting bids within the mev-commit framework, as each commitment
reliably represents its associated bid, regardless of the number of submissions.
