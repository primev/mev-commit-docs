# Opting-in as a Validator

Participation of L1 validators in the mev-commit protocol is crucial as it enhances the integrity of commitments and ensures their enforcement. This document details the steps required to join mev-commit as a Holesky validator.

<Warning>
As a Holesky validator opting into the mev-commit protocol, ensure your mev-boost client only connects to mev-commit opted-in relays to avoid slashing for proposing blocks without delivering commitments.
</Warning>

## Requirements
    By opting-in to the mev-commit protocol as a Holesky validator **in any of the three forms described**, you agree to use the opted-in relays who will filter block builder bids to the addresses that have registered with mev-commit provider registry so they can be slashed in case of protocol violation. This allows validators to passively opt-in to mev-commit and let block builders and relays do the work.
    
    **Supporting Relays:**  

    | Relay | Docs |
    |-------|------|
    | Titan | [docs.titanrelay.xyz](https://docs.titanrelay.xyz/) |
    | Aestus| [holesky.aestus.live](https://holesky.aestus.live/) |

    We expect all known relays to support opting-in to mev-commit within a few months of being live on mainnet. If you are a relay looking to join the mev-commit network please visit our [Relays page](/get-started/relays) to get more information.

    Proposers who fallback to local block production, from either a fault in the mev-boost software or a lack of economically viable block bids, **will not be slashed**. See [flashbots docs](https://docs.flashbots.net/flashbots-mev-boost/architecture-overview/risks#liveness-and-local-fallback) for more on this scenario. The protocol may in the future slash for abuse of this local fallback mechanism.

    ## Eigenlayer Restaking Option

    If you plan to bulk opt-in a large number of validators, check out the [Eigenlayer Operator Registration](v0.6.3/knowledge-base/eigenlayer-operator-registration) guide.

    Otherwise, an individual validator entity can delegate to an existing registered Operator.

    A native-restaking enabled validator opting in to mev-commit requires two high level steps:

    1. The validator must delegate (via eigenlayer core) their native stake to an Operator who's registered with the mev-commit AVS. These can be found on the mev-commit AVS [Eigenlayer dashboard](https://holesky.eigenlayer.xyz/avs/0xededb8ed37a43fd399108a44646b85b780d85dd4). If your existing delegated operator is not registered with mev-commit, you have the option to [change your delegation](https://docs.eigenlayer.xyz/eigenlayer/restaking-guides/restaking-user-guide/restaker-delegation/redelegation-process).
    2. The validator must separately be *registered* with the mev-commit AVS, confirming their attestation to follow the rules of the protocol.

    Step 2 will be facilitated by the `MevCommitAVS.registerValidatorsByPodOwners` function. Frontend instructions are coming soon.

    ### Eigenlayer LST Restaking
    For validator entities to opt-in to mev-commit through Eigenlayer, they must follow the above steps involving native restaking. In addition to this, any LST restaker is able to over-collateralize validators who've already registered with the MevCommitAVS. Rewards and/or points for this method of over-collateralization are TBD. See more [here](https://github.com/primev/mev-commit/tree/main/contracts/contracts/validator-registry/avs#lst-restaker-registration).

  <Tab title="Symbiotic Restaking">
    ## Symbiotic Restaking Option

    This method of validator opt-in is currently being audited and will be available here shortly. Refer to [repo](https://github.com/primev/mev-commit/blob/main/contracts/contracts/validator-registry/middleware/README.md).
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Simple Staking">
    ## Simple Staking Option

    Validators are able to _opt-in to mev-commit_ by staking ETH directly with an L1 contract. This stake is separate from a validator's 32 ETH already staked with the beacon chain. To avoid the extra capital requirement, see restaking options.

    **Prerequisites:**

    1. An operational Holesky validator node.
    2. An operational mev-boost sidecar or equivalent.
    3. An ethereum account funded with the required stake amount + funds for gas.
    
    0.0001 ETH must be staked with the registry contract on Holesky for each validator pubkey (mainnet will require 1 ETH). Below are a few options for obtaining testnet ETH:

    * [Holesky PoW Faucet](https://holesky-faucet.pk910.de/)
    * [Quicknode Faucet](https://faucet.quicknode.com/ethereum/holesky)
    * [Automata Faucet](https://www.holeskyfaucet.io/)

    ### Staking Your Validator Keys

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Visit the Validator Dashboard">
        - Navigate to mev-commit [Validator Dashboard](https://validators.mev-commit.xyz/).
        - Press the "Opt-in to mev-commit" button to connect your wallet.

        </Frame>
      </Step>

      <Step title="Acquire Testnet ETH">   
        - Ensure that you have at least 0.0001 ETH on Holesky per validator pubkey to stake.
        - If you don't have sufficient ETH, see options from above.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Stake Your Validator Keys"> 
        - Click the Stake(lock icon) button on the top right of the dashboard to initiate staking.
        - You can either upload a .txt file containing your keys separated by commas or line breaks, or you can copy and right-click paste the keys directly into the field provided.

        <Frame>
          <img src="/v0.6.3/images/upload-keys.gif" />
        </Frame>
      </Step>

      <Step title="Enter Stake Amounts">  
        - Enter the amount of ETH you wish to stake for each key.
        - Press "Stake" and confirm the transaction on your wallet to finalize the staking of your keys.

        <Frame>
          <img src="/v0.6.3/images/stake.gif" />
        </Frame>
      </Step>

      <Step title="Manage Your Staked Keys"> 
        - After staking, you can view your staked keys by clicking on "Manage Stake".
        - To unstake your keys, you can multi-select the keys or use the meatball(3-dots) menu to unstake them.
        - After unstaking, you will need to wait a 96 block of unstaking period before you can withdraw your ETH. The required waiting period will be displayed for each key on the "Withdraw" column.
