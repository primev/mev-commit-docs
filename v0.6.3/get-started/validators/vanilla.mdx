## Simple Staking Option

Validators are able to _opt-in to mev-commit_ by _vanilla_ staking ETH directly with the `vanillaRegistry` contract. This stake is separate from a validator's 32 ETH already staked with the beacon chain.

The registry strictly accepts BLS public keys as the validator opt-in identifier. Any EOA can stake on behalf of a validator pub key, and only that EOA has the ability to withdraw in the future.

<Warning>
EOAs must only register pubkeys for which they control or otherwise manage. If an EOA registers a pubkey for which they do not own/manage (think “griefing”), the relevant stake amount may be slashed.
</Warning>

The `minStake` parameter represents how much ETH must be staked per validator pubkey to define that validator as opted-in to mev-commit. On mainnet, `minStake` is 1 ETH, while on Holesky it's 0.0001 ETH.

<Note> For large groups of validators, it is recommended to stake in batches of 10-20 public keys at a time to ensure transaction success without hitting gas limits. This process can be tested on Holesky. </Note>
