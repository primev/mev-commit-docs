# Bid Structure

The bid payload sent to the internal mev-commit API is as follows:

```bash
# Example Bid Structure:
# txn_hash: array of txn hashes represented as strings
# bid_amt: amount to bid in wei
# block_number: target block to have bid included
{
    "txHashes": ["0549fc7c57fffbdbfb2cf9d5e0de165fc68dadb5c27c42fdad0bdf506f4eacae", "0549fc7c57fffbdbfb2cf9d5e0de165fc68dadb5c27c42fdad0bdf506f4eacaf","0549fc7c57fffbdbfb2cf9d5e0de165fc68dadb5c27c42fdad0bdf506f4effff"],
    "amount": "100040",
    "blockNumber": 133459
}
```

The final bid structure includes a hash and signature that is auto-constructed by your mev-commit bidder node and looks as follows.

```bash
# Example Bid Structure:
# txn_hash: array of txn hashes represented as strings
# bid_amt: amount to bid in wei
# block_number: target block to have bid included
# bid_digest: hash of the above bid keccak{txn_hash, bid_amt, block_number}
# bid_signature: Signed bid_digest = sign(bid_digest, signing_key)
{
   "txn_hash":"0549fc7c57fffbdbfb2cf9d5e0de165fc68dadb5c27c42fdad0bdf506f4eacae,0549fc7c57fffbdbfb2cf9d5e0de165fc68dadb5c27c42fdad0bdf506f4eacaf,0549fc7c57fffbdbfb2cf9d5e0de165fc68dadb5c27c42fdad0bdf506f4effff",
   "bid_amt":277610,
   "block_number":2703,
   "bid_digest":"uU2p20f5KmehWqpuY1u+CbhcS8jNwdQAJQe2dh0Vnrk=",
   "bid_signature":"nY6jYsGPxj6LVlSVQJbZcxvmRrw8Ym5rqOL1x0W/xPlJGBaF/ZzzjkxiioY/MDiRGvlflSWeoT0fh3aIJiJxAhw="
}
```
Note that the prepay amount a bidder has set needs to be 10 times higher than the bid_amt in the bid. We will be introducing a prepay mechanism in the next testnet milestone.
