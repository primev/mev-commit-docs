Users can submit atomic bundles, ensuring the provider is rewarded only when all transactions are executed as a single unit and in the defined order.

## Example Bundle Payload

Below is an example of a bundle payload that can be submitted by users. This payload ensures that all transactions are executed as a single unit and in the defined order.
```
{
    "txHashes": ["0549fc7c57fffbdbfb2cf9d5e0de165fc68dadb5c27c42fdad0bdf506f4eacae", "0549fc7c57fffbdbfb2cf9d5e0de165fc68dadb5c27c42fdad0bdf506f4eacaf","0549fc7c57fffbdbfb2cf9d5e0de165fc68dadb5c27c42fdad0bdf506f4effff"],
    "amount": "100040",
    "blockNumber": 133459
}
```

If one of the transactions in the `txHashes` list is missing from the produced block, the pre-confirming provider will be slashed if they produced the block. 

For example, if the transaction hash `"0549fc7c57fffbdbfb2cf9d5e0de165fc68dadb5c27c42fdad0bdf506f4eacae"` is missing from the produced block, the pre-confirming provider will be slashed, even if the rest of the transactions are included.
