## Interacting with the Bidder Node

<Note>Ensure you have completed the [Quickstart](/v1.1.0/get-started/quickstart) step in a separate terminal. This will set up your environment and place your key in the `$HOME/.mev-commit` directory, along with running the required bidder node.</Note>

Now that you've made sure we have a bidder node running, we can interact with it using the following commands:

```shell ❯_ terminal
cd $HOME/.mev-commit;
export KEY=$(cat key);
export ADDRESS=$(cast wallet address --private-key 0x$(cat key))
```

## Getting Deposit

To get the currently deposited balance on-chain for a provider:

```shell ❯_ terminal
> curl -s "http://localhost:13523/v1/bidder/get_deposit?provider=0x3C44CdDdB6a900fa2b585dd299e03d12FA4293BC" | jq
{
"amount": "0",
"provider": "0x3C44CdDdB6a900fa2b585dd299e03d12FA4293BC"
}
```

Or to query all deposits and the bidder's EOA balance:

```shell ❯_ terminal
> curl -s "http://localhost:13523/v1/bidder/get_all_deposits" | jq
{
"deposits": [
	{
	"provider": "0x3C44CdDdB6a900fa2b585dd299e03d12FA4293BC",
	"amount": "3000000000000000000"
	}
],
"bidderBalance": "9996999791340641239011"
}
```

<Tip>Deposit represents the funds in the bidder's account that can be used to submit bids on the mev-commit p2p-network and settled on-chain.</Tip>

## Withdraw Deposited Funds

See [Withdraw Funds](/v1.1.0/get-started/bidders/bidder-node-commands#withdraw-funds) below.

## Deposit Manager

It's recommended that bidders leverage the _deposit manager_ to deposit, and automate ongoing re-deposits to specific providers.

The deposit manager is an on-chain contract that a bidder account can enable by "setting their code" to the implementation using EIP-7702. After enabling the deposit manager, a bidder's deposits are automatically replenished from the bidder's EOA balance during the preconf settlement process, according to _target deposit_ amounts configured by the bidder.

A target deposit is the desired amount of funds that a bidder wants to be deposited for a specific provider. Bidders should set this to the maximum cumulative amount of ETH they would ever bid to a provider with respect to a single L1 block.

There are two ways to enable this feature:

### On node boot up (recommended)

The easiest way to enable the deposit manager is by setting two flags/environment variables upon starting your bidder node:

```shell
> ./mev-commit --enable-deposit-manager=true --target-deposit-amount=<amount>
```

Where the target deposit amount will be set for all valid providers that're currently a part of the network. Alternatively you can use the `MEV_COMMIT_ENABLE_DEPOSIT_MANAGER` and `MEV_COMMIT_TARGET_DEPOSIT_AMOUNT` environment variables.

### Through API

To enable the deposit manager through API, use the following command:

```shell
> curl -s -X POST http://localhost:13523/v1/bidder/enable_deposit_manager | jq
{
  "success": true
}
```

Then to set target deposits customized to each provider:

```shell
> curl -s -X POST http://localhost:13523/v1/bidder/set_target_deposits -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"target_deposits":[{"provider":"0x3C44CdDdB6a900fa2b585dd299e03d12FA4293BC","target_deposit":"3000000000000000000"}]}' | jq
{
  "successfullySetDeposits": [
    {
      "provider": "3c44cdddb6a900fa2b585dd299e03d12fa4293bc",
      "targetDeposit": "3000000000000000000"
    }
  ],
  "successfullyToppedUpProviders": [
    "0x3C44CdDdB6a900fa2b585dd299e03d12FA4293BC"
  ]
}
```

## Get Deposit Manager Status

```shell ❯_ terminal
curl -s http://localhost:13523/v1/bidder/deposit_manager_status | jq
```

```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "targetDeposits": [
    {
      "provider": "0x3C44CdDdB6a900fa2b585dd299e03d12FA4293BC",
      "targetDeposit": "3000000000000000000"
    },
    {
      "provider": "0x3C44CdDdB6a900fa2b585dd299e03d12FA4293BC",
      "targetDeposit": "3000000000000000000"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Disable Deposit Manager

To disable the deposit manager call:

```shell ❯_ terminal
curl -X POST http://localhost:13523/v1/bidder/disable_deposit_manager
```

This will set the bidder EOA's code to zero address, effectively disabling the previous EIP-7702 delegation for the EOA.

## Withdraw Funds

To withdraw funds from your deposit to a specific provider, use the following command:

```shell
> curl -s -X POST http://localhost:13523/v1/bidder/request_withdrawals \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "providers": [
      "0x3C44CdDdB6a900fa2b585dd299e03d12FA4293BC"
    ]
  }' | jq
{
  "providers": [
    "3c44cdddb6a900fa2b585dd299e03d12fa4293bc"
  ],
  "amounts": [
    "3000000000000000000"
  ]
}
```

Then you must wait the withdrawal period to elapse, currently ~10 minutes. Then finally call:

```shell
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:13523/v1/bidder/withdraw \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "providers": [
      "0x3C44CdDdB6a900fa2b585dd299e03d12FA4293BC"
    ]
  }' | jq
{
  "providers": [
    "3c44cdddb6a900fa2b585dd299e03d12fa4293bc"
  ],
  "amounts": [
    "3000000000000000000"
  ]
}
```

## Checking the Balance of your Wallet

### Mainnet
This command will allow you to check your current wallet balance on mainnet mev-commit chain:

```shell ❯_ terminal
cast b $ADDRESS --rpc-url https://chainrpc.mev-commit.xyz
```
### Testnet
This command will allow you to check your current wallet balance on testnet mev-commit chain:

```shell ❯_ terminal
cast b $ADDRESS --rpc-url https://chainrpc.testnet.mev-commit.xyz
```

## Check Total Value Locked in Contracts
### Mainnet
```shell ❯_ terminal
python3 -c "print($(cast b 0xb772Add4718E5BD6Fe57Fb486A6f7f008E52167E \
--rpc-url https://chainrpc.mev-commit.xyz) + $(cast b 0xC973D09e51A20C9Ab0214c439e4B34Dbac52AD67 \
--rpc-url https://chainrpc.mev-commit.xyz))"
```
### Testnet
```shell ❯_ terminal
python3 -c "print($(cast b 0x401B3287364f95694c43ACA3252831cAc02e5C41 \
--rpc-url https://chainrpc.testnet.mev-commit.xyz) + $(cast b 0xf4F10e18244d836311508917A3B04694D88999Dd \
--rpc-url https://chainrpc.testnet.mev-commit.xyz))"
```

## Health
The health endpoint checks whether the bidder node is receiving events from mev-commit chain. This command is useful to determine whether the bidder node has become out of sync.
```shell ❯_ terminal
curl http://localhost:13523/health
```

## Topology
The topology endpoint can be used to check which provider nodes the bidder node is connected to. 
```shell ❯_ terminal
curl http://localhost:13523/v1/debug/topology
```

## Querying for Proposers API

This API is enabled by default, the following environment variables could be set when launching a mev-commit client:

- `MEV_COMMIT_VALIDATOR_ROUTER_ADDR`
- `MEV_COMMIT_BEACON_API_URL`
- `MEV_COMMIT_L1_RPC_URL`

import { HoodiValidatorOptInRouterAddress } from '/snippets/testnet-addresses.mdx';
import { ValidatorOptInRouterProxyAddress } from '/snippets/mainnet-addresses.mdx';

Current address for the ValidatorOptInRouter contract on Hoodi is {HoodiValidatorOptInRouterAddress} and on Mainnet is {ValidatorOptInRouterProxyAddress}.

The default URLs for the *Mainnet* Beacon Chain and L1 RPC are https://ethereum-beacon-api.publicnode.com and https://ethereum-rpc.publicnode.com, respectively, but you can set your own URLs.

The default URLs for the *Testnet* Beacon Chain and L1 RPC are https://ethereum-hoodi-beacon-api.publicnode.com and https://ethereum-hoodi-rpc.publicnode.com, respectively, but you can set your own URLs.

To get the information on whether validators for a specific epoch are opted in to mev-commit:

```shell ❯_ terminal
curl http://localhost:13523/v1/validator/get_validators?epoch=1
```

To get the information on whether validators for a latest epoch are opted in to mev-commit:

```shell ❯_ terminal
curl http://localhost:13523/v1/validator/get_validators
```

You can also subscribe to notifications to receive real-time updates when validators opt in or when a new epoch starts with opted-in validators. To subscribe to these notifications:
```shell ❯_ terminal
curl -N -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"topics": ["validator_opted_in", "epoch_validators_opted_in"]}' http://localhost:13523/v1/subscribe
```

This will establish a streaming connection that will send notifications when:
* The next block proposer has opted in to the mev-commit protocol (`validator_opted_in`)
* A new epoch begins, providing a list of all opted-in validators for that epoch (`epoch_validators_opted_in`)

Note proposer selection is only stable within the context of the current epoch, and must be checked during the epoch in question. See specification [here](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/validator.md#validator-assignments) and [here](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/validator.md#lookahead). 

## Configuring custom provider sets

Users can also set-up a specific subset of provider nodes in order to send their bids. By default the mev-commit bidder node will send bids to all the available and staked providers. However, if the user wants only a specific subset of providers to be able to see their bids, the can use the `--provider-whitelist` option to set it up. The list should contain the ethereum wallet addresses of the provider nodes.

### Mainnet
```shell ❯_ terminal
mev-commit --keystore-path ~/.mev-commit \
 --keystore-password <PASSWORD> \
	--bootnodes /dnsaddr/bootnode.mev-commit.xyz \
	--settlement-rpc-endpoint https://chainrpc.mev-commit.xyz
  --provider-whitelist 0x6DcE7bcF4fCA9E14b546e583049B82474631b185,0x0979c194EaD08444B6e40415F5822AB32363f580
```

### Testnet
```shell ❯_ terminal
mev-commit --keystore-path ~/.mev-commit \
 --keystore-password <PASSWORD> \
	--bootnodes /dnsaddr/bootnode.testnet.mev-commit.xyz \
	--settlement-rpc-endpoint https://chainrpc.testnet.mev-commit.xyz
  --provider-whitelist 0x6DcE7bcF4fCA9E14b546e583049B82474631b185,0x0979c194EaD08444B6e40415F5822AB32363f580
```
