## Rules for Providers

To participate in the mev-commit network, providers must adhere to the following requirements:

- **Node Availability**: Providers must operate a mev-commit provider node continuously, ensuring high availability and reliability.
- **Consistent Commitment**: Providers must be willing to commit to profitable bids for all available slots.
- **Builder Activity**: The associated builder must have consistently produced at least 0.5% of recent mev-boost blocks to demonstrate meaningful network contribution.
