### New: Hyperliquid Support (Early Access)

We're extending mev-commit to support **Hyperliquid** â€” a novel L1 built for high-performance order execution. ðŸŽ‰

Hyperliquid support is available **via custom bootnode and privacy setup**. See [Hyperliquid Network](/v1.1.0/developers/networks/hyperliquid)
.
