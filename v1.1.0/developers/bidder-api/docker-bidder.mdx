The mev-commit bidder setup leverages Docker to deploy a bidder node service within a single container, the repository [can be found here](https://github.com/primev/bidder_node_docker) . This bidder node connects to the mev-commit chain, enabling users to submit bids seamlessly. 
By containerizing the service, you ensure a consistent and reproducible environment, simplifying deployment and scaling.

# Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- Docker: Install Docker on your machine. You can download it from the official Docker website.
- Docker Compose: Ensure Docker Compose is installed. It typically comes bundled with Docker Desktop, but you can verify by running docker-compose --version.
- A funded mev-commit address.
- A valid Holesky or Mainnet private key for authentication. If you need testnet funds, use the MEV-Commit [faucet](https://faucet.testnet.mev-commit.xyz/).

                                                                                                 
# Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to set up and run your mev-commit bidder node.

1. Clone the Repository
Begin by cloning the repository to your local machine:

```bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/mev-commit-bidder-docker.git
cd mev-commit-bidder-docker
```
                                                                                                 
2. Configure Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory of the repository to store your environment variables securely.

Create the .env file:

```bash
Copy code
touch .env
```

Define the required variables:

Open the .env file in your preferred text editor and add the following:

```env
Copy code
PRIVATE_KEY_BIDDER=your_private_key_here
DOMAIN=testnet.mev-commit.xyz
```

Replace your_private_key_here with your actual private key.
The DOMAIN variable defaults to testnet.mev-commit.xyz, but you can modify it if needed.

3. Build and Run Docker Containers
With the environment configured, proceed to build and run the Docker containers.
```bash
Copy code
docker-compose up --build
```

This command performs the following actions:

- Builds the Docker image based on Ubuntu 20.04.
- Installs necessary dependencies such as curl and jq.
- Downloads and installs the latest MEV-Commit binary from the official repository.
- Starts the bidder node service within the container.


# Customization
Tailor the bidder node to fit your specific needs by adjusting environment variables or modifying the startup script.

## Modifying the Entry Point
The container uses an entrypoint.sh script to initiate the bidder service. If you need to alter the startup sequence:

Edit the entrypoint.sh script:

Locate and open the entrypoint.sh file in the repository. Make your desired changes to customize the startup behavior.

Rebuild the Docker Image:

After modifying the script, rebuild the Docker image to apply the changes:

```bash
Copy code
docker-compose up --build
```
                                                                                                 
## Networking with Other Repositories
Before deploying your containers, create a shared Docker network:

```bash
Copy code
docker network create app-network
```
                                                                                                 
This network, named app-network, facilitates communication between the bidder node and other services.

## Using the Network with Other Containers
To enable other Docker services to communicate with the MEV-Commit bidder node, ensure they reference the same app-network. Here's how to configure another repository's docker-compose.yml to join the network:

```yaml
Copy code
version: '3'
services:
  bid-sender:
    image: your-bid-sender-image
    networks:
      - app-network
    environment:
      - RPC_ENDPOINT=http://mev-commit-bidder:13524

networks:
  app-network:
    external: true
```
