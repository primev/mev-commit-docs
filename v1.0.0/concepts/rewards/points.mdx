# mev-commit Points Program

The `mev-commit` Points Program rewards validators who opt-in and remain actively opted-in. Points accrue over **6-month Seasons**, with each Season offering base points plus growing multipliers. All points will be visible on the [Validator Dashboard](https://validators.mev-commit.xyz/) like the screenshot below. Read more to learn how points are awarded and how to maximize your total.

## Quick Overview

- **Immediate Reward:** Earn **1,000 points** per validator right when you opt in.  
- **6-Month Seasons:** Completing an entire Season nets you up to **10,000 points** total in Season 1, and double for following seasons.  
- **Multipliers:**  
  - Season 1: base schedule (see table below).  
  - Season 2 & 3: rewards are **2×** each month’s total.  
- **Opt-Out Penalties:** If you opt out early during a season, you keep the **base points** for fully completed months but **lose** that month’s multiplier.

**Tip**: Stay opted in with as many validators through all seasons for the maximum multiplier bonus.

| 1     | 1,000                                      |
| 2     | 1,270                                      |
| 3     | 1,530                                      |
| 4     | 1,800                                      |
| 5     | 2,070                                      |
| 6     | 2,330                                      |
| **Total** | **10,000**                             |

- Points accrue **daily**, but the monthly multiplier is only **finalized** if you remain opted-in through each 6 month Season.
- **Season 2 & 3** double all monthly totals shown above.

## Points Chart
Below is a visualization of your points over the planned 3 Seasons. Accrued points represent all points available at the end of a season. Solidified points represent points that will remain with your operator before a Season is over.

## Aggregated Points at Operator Level

Your dashboard displays **one aggregate total** across all your opted-in validators. Operators can see total points and watch them grow daily.

## Maximize Points via Partner Protocols

You can earn additional or parallel rewards when using partner protocols alongside `mev-commit`:
  
- **EigenLayer:** Operators opted-in to the `mev-commit AVS` on EigenLayer may earn `$eigen` token rewards (based on EigenLayer’s policies).
- **Symbiotic, Mellow, SSV:** Opt-in validators using these protocols to earn points from them AND mev-commit. Points will be available on the Symbiotic dashboard as well.

## Opt-Out Scenarios

- **Before Month Ends**  
  - You keep points from previous fully completed months.  
  - You **forfeit** any partially accrued points for the current month.

- **Before 6 Months But After Some Full Months**  
  - You keep **1,000 base points** for each fully completed month in Season 1, double for subsequent seasons.  
  - You **lose** the monthly multiplier for those months.
  - Example: If you leave before the end of a Season, you only keep 1,000 for each completed month without the monthly multiplier.

- **Opting Out and Re-Opting In**  
  - A **7-day cooldown** applies for each validator key if you opt out. If you have trouble with this, reach out to our team.
  - Rejoining resets you to Season 1 status.
