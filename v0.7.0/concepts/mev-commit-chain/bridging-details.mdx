# Understanding Bridging Mechanisms

The mev-commit chain utilizes a standard bridging mechanism to ensure a secure and efficient transfer of ETH between mainnet Ethereum and the mev-commit chain.

We envision mev-commit to eventually integrate with a multitude of interoperability protocols (think wormhole, layerzero, etc.). In the meantime Primev has implemented its own lock/mint bridging protocol as described below.

## Lock/Mint Peg

Native ETH on the mev-commit chain maintains a 1:1 peg with ETH on L1. The only way to mint ETH on the mev-commit chain is to lock an equivalent amount on L1. ETH can be burned on the mev-commit chain to release/receive an equivalent amount on L1.

## Security 

There are inherent security assumptions in bridging ETH to the mev-commit chain. While these are similar to other bridge trust assumptions, we've listed them below:

- Liveness of the bridge relayer actor.
- POA signers that maintain mev-commit chain state.
- Correctness of Primev's [standard bridge protocol](https://github.com/primev/mev-commit-bridge/tree/main/standard/bridge-v1) and integration into the mev-commit chain.

Our standard bridge implementation has been audited by Cantina. More details can be found [here](https://blog.primev.xyz/Battle-Testing-mev-commit-Key-Findings-from-Our-Spearbit-Security-Review-1436865efd6f8025bd6ce3824349821d).

## **Importance of Origin Chain Security**

**Selective Bridging**: Only bridges originating from Ethereum L1 should be allowed to mint native ETH on the mev-commit chain. This is to prevent the impact of compromised states on other chains affecting the mev-commit chain.

## Bridge Contracts

See **Bridge Contracts** section of [contracts page](/v0.7.0/developers/contracts) to gain context on contracts necessary to enable bridging.

## Relayer

The main off-chain component of the bridge is the relayer. Primev currently operates the relayer, with open-sourced implementation [here](https://github.com/primev/mev-commit/tree/main/bridge/standard).
