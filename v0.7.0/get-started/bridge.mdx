<p> The mev-commit chain uses the native ETH tokens that need to be bridged from L1. We use a lock and mint bridge. A user CLI application can be downloaded from the [releases page](https://github.com/primev/mev-commit/releases/latest). </p>

<Note>In order to bridge funds, users need to have an account which is funded with Holesky ETH for testnet. </Note>

	--dest-addr <Address to fund on the mev-commit chain> \
	--amount <Amount in Wei>
```

```bash ❯_ bridge to L1 from settlement chain

	--dest-addr <Address to fund on the mev-commit chain> \
