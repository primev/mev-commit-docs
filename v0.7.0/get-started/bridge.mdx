<p> The mev-commit chain uses the native ETH tokens that need to be bridged from L1. We use a lock and mint bridge. A user CLI application can be downloaded from the [releases page](https://github.com/primev/mev-commit/releases/latest). </p>

<Note>In order to bridge funds, users need to have an account which is funded with Holesky ETH for testnet. </Note>

<CodeGroup>

```bash ❯_ bridge to settlement chain from L1
user-cli bridge-to-settlement \
	--account-key <Private Key of source account> \
	--dest-addr <Address to fund on the mev-commit chain> \
	--amount <Amount in Wei>
```

```bash ❯_ bridge to L1 from settlement chain
user-cli bridge-to-l1 \
	--account-key <Private Key of source account> \
	--dest-addr <Address to fund on the mev-commit chain> \
	--amount <Amount in Wei>
```

</CodeGroup>

<Note> Users can also use a keystore file instead of using the private key. </Note>

<Note> Currently the CLI uses the default contract addresses for testnet and the default RPC endpoints. Users can use separate RPC URLs using the respective options. </Note>

<p> To check other options available in the user CLI, users can use the `-h` option </p>
