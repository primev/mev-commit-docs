---

mev-commit uses a reward and slashing system to ensure providers and validators act honestly. Both must stake tokens to participate — honest behavior is rewarded, dishonest behavior is penalized.

## Validator Rewards

Validators earn more by opting in to mev-commit:

- **Higher block value** — Preconfirmation bids increase the total value of blocks proposed through mev-boost. Validators passively earn this extra value just by proposing blocks from mev-commit providers.
- **Points** — Opted-in validators earn [points](/v1.2.x/concepts/rewards-and-slashing/points) for each block proposed while opted in.

The more validators opt in, the more credible preconfirmations become, which increases their value — creating a positive feedback loop.

## Validator Slashing

The risk of slashing is very low for validators acting in good faith:

- **Missed blocks** — Not slashed. Network issues and chain reorgs are outside the validator's control.
- **Self-built blocks** — Not slashed. Rare edge case when relay value is too low.
- **Block from unsupported relay** — Slashed 1 ETH. This indicates misconfiguration or intentional misbehavior.

<Tip>An [independent report by Chaos Labs](https://governance.ether.fi/t/primev-symbiotic-risk-analysis/) confirms the risk/reward profile is favorable for validators.</Tip>

## Provider Rewards

Providers (block builders) earn from fulfilling commitments:

- **Fulfilled commitment** — Provider receives the bid amount minus a 2% protocol fee.
- **Neutral outcome** — If the provider didn't win the block, no action is taken. No reward, no penalty.

## Provider Slashing

Providers are penalized for breaking commitments they issued:

- **Broken commitment** — Provider is slashed the bid's specified slash amount, plus a 5% penalty fee. The slash amount goes to the bidder; the penalty goes to the protocol treasury.
- **Insufficient stake** — If the provider can't cover the full slash, the bidder is paid first, then the treasury receives whatever remains.

Decay is **not** applied to slash amounts — providers are slashed the full specified amount regardless of timing.
