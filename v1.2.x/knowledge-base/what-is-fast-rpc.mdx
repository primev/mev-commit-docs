FAST RPC is a drop-in replacement for standard Ethereum RPC endpoints that enables preconfirmations. It works like a normal Ethereum node — you send transactions via `eth_sendRawTransaction` and check receipts via `eth_getTransactionReceipt` — but under the hood it coordinates with mev-commit's decentralized network of block builders to preconfirm your transactions.

## How It Works

1. You configure your wallet or dapp to point at `https://fastrpc.mev-commit.xyz` instead of a standard RPC like Infura or Alchemy.
2. When you send a transaction, the RPC encrypts it and sends bids to block builders in the mev-commit network.
3. Once all registered builders issue a commitment and the next block proposer is opted in, the transaction is preconfirmed.
4. `eth_getTransactionReceipt` returns a receipt immediately — no waiting 12+ seconds for the next block.

## Who Is It For?

- **Wallets** — Add the RPC as a custom network and get instant transaction confirmation UX. No deposit needed during the promotional period — gas is fully sponsored.
- **dApps** — Integrate preconfirmations with minimal code changes. Deposit ETH into a gas tank, then use standard RPC methods as usual.
- **Developers** — Access additional methods like `mevcommit_getTransactionCommitments` and `mevcommit_optedInBlock` for advanced preconfirmation logic.

## Key Benefits

- **Sub-second confirmation UX** — Transactions are preconfirmed in ~100-200ms, compared to 12+ seconds on standard Ethereum.
- **Drop-in compatibility** — Works with existing wallets and tools. No protocol changes or special SDKs required.
- **Gasless for wallets** — During the promotional period, the RPC sponsors transaction fees for wallet users.
- **mev redistribution** — Value captured through preconfirmations flows back to users and validators, not extractors.
