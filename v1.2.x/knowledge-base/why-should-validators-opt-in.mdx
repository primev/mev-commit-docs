Fast Protocol is designed so that **opting in is rational and strictly profitable** for validators. This page explains the incentive model and what validators gain.

## What Opted-In Validators Earn

| Validator Type | Approx. mev Capture | Reason |
| -------------- | ------------------- | ------ |
| **Opted-In** | ~95% of FAST RPC mev | Full backrun mev + residual |
| **Not Opted-In** | ~5% of FAST RPC mev | Similar to mev Blocker |

Opted-in validators enjoy approximately **20x higher mev capture** on FAST RPC flows compared to non-opted-in validators.

## Where the Value Comes From

Opted-in validators gain from three sources:

1. **Backrun-captured mev** from FAST RPC bundles routed to their blocks
2. **Their share of traditional builder-to-validator mev** (unaffected by opting in)
3. **Competitive advantage** in attracting order flow — searchers and builders prefer blocks where their bundles will be honored

## When Is Opting In Profitable?

Opting in is profitable whenever Fast Protocol generates more than approximately **5.6% of total block mev**. In practice, Fast Protocol exceeds this threshold comfortably.

The validator pays a small 5% fee on total block mev when opted in, but the mev capture from FAST RPC bundles far exceeds this cost.

## How to Opt In

Validators can opt in through the mev-commit protocol. See the [Validator Guide](/v1.2.x/get-started/validators/validator-guide) for setup instructions, or register via [EigenLayer](/v1.2.x/get-started/validators/eigenlayer) or [Symbiotic](/v1.2.x/get-started/validators/symbiotic) for restaking-based opt-in.
