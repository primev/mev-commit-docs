description: "An x402 payment facilitator for AI agents — sub-second USDC settlement on Ethereum mainnet."
---

Fastx402 is an [x402](https://www.x402.org/) payment facilitator that lets AI agents and applications pay for resources on Ethereum mainnet using USDC. It achieves sub-second settlement through [FAST RPC](/v1.2.x/knowledge-base/what-is-fast-rpc) preconfirmations.

## The Problem

Ethereum's 12+ second finality makes it unsuitable for real-time agent payments. An AI agent that needs to pay for an API call can't wait 12 seconds for confirmation — it needs a response in milliseconds. Existing x402 facilitators solve this by operating on Base or Solana, but that means agents can't access Ethereum's deep USDC liquidity.

## How It Works

Fastx402 uses USDC's native EIP-3009 `transferWithAuthorization` function for gasless, signature-based payments:

1. An agent encounters a `402 Payment Required` response from a resource server.
2. The agent signs an EIP-712 authorization message — no on-chain transaction needed.
3. The resource server forwards the signed payment to Fastx402's `/settle` endpoint.
4. Fastx402 verifies the signature and submits the transaction via FAST RPC.
5. FAST RPC preconfirms the transaction in ~100-200ms.
6. The resource server receives confirmation and grants access.

## Key Features

- **Sub-second settlement** — ~1.2 seconds end-to-end via FAST RPC preconfirmations (vs 12+ seconds on standard Ethereum).
- **Zero gas for agents** — Agents only need USDC. A relay wallet submits the on-chain transaction and covers gas.
- **Zero fees** — No facilitator fee during the promotional period.
- **Mainnet liquidity** — Access Ethereum's largest stablecoin issuance and DeFi ecosystem directly.
- **x402 compatible** — Drop-in replacement for any x402 facilitator. Works with the standard x402 flow.
