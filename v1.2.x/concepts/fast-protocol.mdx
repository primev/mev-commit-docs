This document explains how **FAST RPC**, **mev-commit**, and the **Fast Protocol** collectively capture, route, and redistribute mev. It aims to give engineers, integrators, and validators a clear understanding of the value flows, incentive design, and equilibrium properties of the system.

---

## Overview of Fast Protocol

FAST RPC adds an **order flow auction (OFA)** on top of **mev-commit**. When users send transactions through FAST RPC:

- The RPC auctions and simulates backruns
- Mev is realized through backrun bundles
- Builders commit via mev-commit
- A portion of the mev goes to validators, depending on opt-in status
- The rest flows into the **mev distribution contracts**, forming the basis of tokenized mev rewards

The system ensures:

- Users receive **≥90%** of the mev their transactions generate when feasible
- Opted-in validators earn **significantly more** mev than non-opted-in validators
- The protocol achieves a **unique equilibrium** where no competing OFA can sustainably pay users more

# Mev Flow & Core Definitions

## Mev Components

For each mev-commit bundle:

$$
M_{bundle} = M_{bid} + M_{priority} + M_{direct}
$$

Where:

- $M_{bid}$ — the builder’s decayed commitment  
- $M_{priority}$ — sum of transaction priority fees  
- $M_{direct}$ — any explicit builder payment  

We also define:

- $M_{rpc}$ — total MEV generated by FAST RPC transactions  
- $M_{block}$ — total MEV in the block  
- $\rho = \dfrac{M_{rpc}}{M_{block}}$ — share of block mev attributable to FAST RPC
- $\rho' = \dfrac{M_{bundle}}{M_{rpc}}$ — fraction of RPC mev appearing in bundles  

---

## Fee Parameters

FAST Protocol uses two fees:

- **Mev fee on bundles:**

  $$
  \text{mev\_fee} = f_{mev} \cdot M_{bundle}
  $$

- **Validator fee (opted-in only):**

  $$
  \text{val\_fee} = f_{val} \cdot M_{block}
  $$

Typical values:

| Parameter       | Value | Meaning                       |
| -------------- | ----- | ----------------------------- |
| $f_{mev}$      | 0.05  | 5% mev fee on bundles         |
| $f_{val}$      | 0.05  | 5% validator fee              |
| $\mu_{builder}$| ~0.10 | Builder’s margin on RPC mev   |

# FAST RPC mev Generation

## Per-transaction mev estimation

For each transaction $tx$:

$$
m(tx) = \text{estimated backrun profit}
$$

Total mev driven by FAST RPC in a given slot:

$$
M_{rpc} = \sum_{tx} m(tx)
$$

---

# Mev Redistribution Model

Redistributed mev accumulates into a pool $T$ composed of:

- Builder mev fees ($f_{mev} M_{bundle}$)
- Validator fees ($f_{val} M_{block}$)
- Backrun-captured mev from non-opt-in slots

---

## User Distribution

Each user $u$ has a weight:

$$
w_u = \frac{M_{rpc}^{(u)}}{M_{rpc}}
$$

Their payout is:

$$
P_u = T \cdot \tau_{rpc} \cdot w_u
$$

Payout may be delivered in points or tokens depending on availability.

---

# User Refund Ratio (\gamma)

Define:

$$
\gamma = \frac{T \cdot \tau_{rpc}}{M_{rpc}}
$$

Interpretation:

- $\gamma = 0.9$ → 90% mev refund  
- $\gamma > 1$ → users receive **more than 100%** of their generated mev

System objectives:

- Maintain $\gamma \ge 0.9$ under normal conditions  
- Allow $\gamma > 1$ in mev-rich phases (treasury surplus)

---
# Adaptive Parameter Logic

The protocol continuously adjusts how much mev goes to users versus the protocol treasury based on how abundant mev is in a given period. Let:

$$
r = \frac{M_{rpc}}{T}
$$

The protocol adapts how value is split between users and stakers based on mev abundance, summarized by the parameter $r$.

---

## Case 1 — Scarce mev

When mev relative to the redistribution pool is scarce (high $r$), the system caps what it can give back while preserving protocol sustainability.

We can express the scarce regime as:

$$
r > r_{\text{crit}}
$$

for some critical $r_{\text{crit}}$ corresponding numerically to:

- approximately $\dfrac{0.95}{0.9}$ in the original parameterization.

In this regime:

$$
\tau_{rpc} = \tau_{\text{max}}
$$

$$
\tau_{fast} = 1 - \tau_{\text{max}}
$$

with $\tau_{\text{max}}$ set so that users get as much as the system can afford (slightly under 90% refunds in the most constrained conditions).

---

## Case 2 — Mev Rich

When mev is abundant relative to the pool, i.e.

$$
r \le r_{\text{crit}},
$$

the protocol:

- Preserves at least a 90% user refund on average
- Allocates the surplus between users based on the share of mev they generate
- Keeps a minimum fraction of value for FAST stakers and the protocol

We can express $\tau_{rpc}$ generically as:

$$
\tau_{rpc} = a \cdot r + b \cdot (1 - r)
$$

for suitable constants $a$ and $b$ chosen so that:

- Users always receive at least 90% of their generated mev on average
- FAST stakers and the protocol receive at least 5% in total

Then:

$$
\tau_{fast} = 1 - \tau_{rpc}
$$

In practice, parameter choices are tuned so that:

- For typical orderflow conditions, $\gamma$ is around or above $0.9$
- In MEV-rich conditions, $\gamma$ can exceed $1$, sharing surplus with users while still rewarding stakers

This ensures:

- Users always receive ≥90%
- Protocol always receives ≥5%
- Treasury surpluses enhance both sides proportionally

# Validator Incentive Model

FAST Protocol is designed so that **opting in is rational and strictly profitable** for validators.

Opted-in validators gain:

- All backrun-captured mev from FAST RPC bundles  
- Their share of traditional builder → validator mev  
- Competitive advantage in attracting order flow  

Non-opted-in validators receive only the small residual share left after RPC backruns and mev fees.

---

## Opt-in Profit Condition

Incremental profit from opting in:

$$
\Delta_{opt} = M_{rpc} \cdot (1 - \mu_{builder}) - f_{val} \cdot M_{block}
$$

Opt-in is profitable if:

$$
\rho > \frac{f_{val}}{1 - \mu_{builder}}
$$

With typical values ($f_{val} = 0.05$, $\mu_{builder} = 0.10$):

$$
\rho > 0.0555
$$

Meaning:

**If FAST RPC generates more than ~5.6% of block mev, opting in and even paying a 5% fee is profitable.**

In practice, FAST RPC exceeds this threshold comfortably.

---

## What Validators Earn

| Validator Type    | Approx. RPC mev Capture | Reason                        |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Opted-In**      | ~95%                    | Backrun mev + residual        |
| **Not Opted-In**  | ~5%                     | Similar to Mev Blocker        |

Opted-in validators therefore enjoy **~20× higher MEV capture** on FAST RPC flows.

---

# Why FAST RPC Is the Best-Paying OFA

The equilibrium analysis shows:

- If FAST RPC offered **less** than 90% user refunds, users would defect to other options  
- If an OFA tried offering **more**, its builders or validators would become unprofitable  
- FAST RPC optimally balances incentives so validators, builders, stakers, and users all remain profitable  

Thus, no competing OFA can sustainably provide higher user mev refunds than FAST RPC.

---

# Summary

Fast Protocol transforms mev into a transparent, shared, incentive-aligned mechanism:

- **Users** receive top-of-market mev refunds (≥90%, often >100%)  
- **Validators** earn strictly more when opting in, and materially more than in other OFA systems  
- **Builders** maintain sustainable margins while delivering transactions  
- **The protocol** becomes more valuable as usage increases, creating a positive feedback loop  

The design is mathematically constrained, incentive-compatible, and self-stabilizing under normal market conditions.
