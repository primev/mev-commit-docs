The [mev-commit Explorer](https://mev-commit.xyz) is a blockchain explorer for the mev-commit settlement chain (Chain ID: 57173). It provides decoded transaction data, real-time block and transaction feeds, and address lookup for the mev-commit network.

## Features

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Decoded Transactions" icon="code">
    Every transaction to a known settlement contract is decoded into human-readable function calls with parameter names, types, and values.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Revert Reasons" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    Failed transactions show the decoded revert reason instead of just a generic failure status.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Contract Badges" icon="badge-check">
    Known settlement contracts display as verified badges with their contract name instead of raw hex addresses.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Cross-Reference Links" icon="link">
    Commitment indices link to storing transactions. L1 block numbers and tx hashes link to Etherscan.
  </Card>

## Settlement Contracts

The explorer decodes interactions with these core protocol contracts:

| Contract | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **PreconfManager** | Manages preconfirmation commitments between bidders and providers |
| **BidderRegistry** | Tracks bidder registrations and deposits |
| **ProviderRegistry** | Tracks provider registrations and stakes |
| **Oracle** | Settles commitments based on L1 block outcomes |
| **BlockTracker** | Records L1 block numbers for settlement reference |
| **SettlementGateway** | Handles cross-chain settlement operations |

## Using the Explorer

### Look up an address

Navigate to `https://mev-commit.xyz/address/<address>` to view:
- Current ETH balance on the mev-commit chain

- IN/OUT labels showing transaction direction

### Inspect a transaction

Click any transaction hash to see:
- Decoded input data (function name and parameters)
- Revert reason for failed transactions
- Gas usage and block information
- From/to addresses with contract name badges

### Browse blocks

The home page shows a real-time feed of blocks and transactions. Click any block number to see all transactions in that block.
