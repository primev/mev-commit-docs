    ### Quickstart 1-2-3

  <Accordion title="[Optional] Create an Ethereum account">
    First you'll need to obtain or create a standard Ethereum account (secp256k1 keypair). We highly recommend storing your account in a password protected keystore file, rather than storing the private key unencrypted. If you plan to fund this account with a non-trivial amount of ETH, please independently verify any tools and/or procedures you adopt.

    If you already have a keystore generated, or want to use an existing L1 account's keystore, you're good to move on from this step.
    
    Otherwise the quickest way to generate a new keystore is to install geth and create the file in a single command:

    <CodeGroup>
    ```shell ❯_ MacOS using brew
    brew install geth && geth account new --keystore $HOME/keystore
    ```

    ```shell ❯_ Ubuntu using apt
    sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:ethereum/ethereum && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y geth && geth account new --keystore $HOME/keystore

    ```
    </CodeGroup>

    <Accordion title="Convert an existing private key file into a keystore">
        ```shell ❯_
        brew install geth && geth account import --keystore "$HOME/keystore" private_key_file.txt
        ```
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Create a new keystore file programmatically">

        Import geth as a dependency in your golang project and programmatically create a new keystore file. Read more [here](https://goethereumbook.org/keystore/).

        ```go
        package main

        import (
            "fmt"
            "log"
            "os"
            "path/filepath"

            "github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/accounts/keystore"
        )

        func main() {
            home, err := os.UserHomeDir()
            if err != nil {
                log.Fatal(err)
            }
            keystoreDir := filepath.Join(home, "keystore")
            ks := keystore.NewKeyStore(keystoreDir, keystore.StandardScryptN, keystore.StandardScryptP)
            password := os.Getenv("PASSWORD")
            if password == "" {
                log.Fatal("PASSWORD environment variable not set")
            }
            account, err := ks.NewAccount(password)
            if err != nil {
                log.Fatal(err)
            }
            fmt.Println("New account address:", account.Address.Hex())
            fmt.Println("Keystore file saved in:", keystoreDir)
        }
        ```
    </Accordion>

  </Accordion>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Bridge to the mev-commit chain">
    In order to fund your account on the mev-commit chain, you'll need to bridge ETH from an L1 account. We suggest using our web interface at [mev-commit.xyz/bridge](https://www.mev-commit.xyz/bridge).
    
    You can move forward while the bridge transaction completes in ~15m (detailed instructions in our [Bridge UI guide](/v1.2.x/get-started/bridge/bridge)). For testnet use [hoodi.mev-commit.xyz/bridge](https://hoodi.mev-commit.xyz/bridge)

    <Accordion title="CLI alternative for bridging">

    For automated or programmatic bridging, you can use our CLI tool by first confirming your operating system and architecture by running `uname -sm`, then downloading the appropriate bridge user CLI binary from the [releases](https://github.com/primev/mev-commit/releases/latest) page. 

    Or use the following command which automatically downloads and extracts the latest bridge user CLI binary for your system into your $HOME directory:
    ```shell
    curl -Ls $(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/primev/mev-commit/releases \
      | grep browser_download_url \
      | grep "mev-commit-bridge-user-cli_[0-9].*$(uname -s)_$(uname -m)\.tar\.gz" \
      | cut -d '"' -f 4 \
      | head -n1) | tar -xz -C ~
    ```

    The binary will then be available in your $HOME directory as `user-cli`.

    The CLI application provides two sub-commands to bridge to and from the settlement chain. For more details go the the [bridge CLI documentation](/v1.2.x/get-started/bridge/bridge-cli).

    <Note> When using the bridge CLI, make sure to specify the newly generated account address from the previous step as the destination address for the bridge command. </Note>

    ```shell ❯_ example
    ./user-cli bridge-to-settlement --account-key <PRIVATE KEY of source account for funds> --dest-addr <Address to fund on mev-commit chain> --amount 1000000000000000000
    ```
    </Accordion>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Run a mev-commit node">

    Navigate to the [mev-commit releases page](https://github.com/primev/mev-commit/releases/) and download the appropriate binary for your system. Since you're reading the `v1.2.x` version of the docs, choose a release starting with `v1.2`.

    You can use the following command which automatically downloads and extracts the latest mev-commit binary for your system into your $HOME directory:
    ```shell
    curl -Ls $(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/primev/mev-commit/releases/latest \
      | grep browser_download_url \
      | grep "mev-commit_[0-9].*$(uname -s)_$(uname -m).*\.tar\.gz" \
      | cut -d '"' -f 4 \
      | head -n1) | tar -xz -C ~
    ```

    Run `cd $HOME` if you used the command above.
    
    Now execute the node binary, selecting either a bidder or provider configuration based on your role in the network. Bidders must set a `target-deposit-amount` which will be deposited for each valid provider, in order to send bids.

    <CodeGroup>

    ```bash ❯_ bidder
    ./mev-commit \
        --keystore-path $HOME/keystore \
        --keystore-password <PASSWORD> \
        --enable-deposit-manager=true \
        --target-deposit-amount <WEI_AMOUNT> \
        --bootnodes /dnsaddr/bootnode.mev-commit.xyz \
        --settlement-rpc-endpoint https://chainrpc.mev-commit.xyz
    ```

    ```bash ❯_ provider
    ./mev-commit \
        --peer-type provider \
        --keystore-path $HOME/keystore \
        --keystore-password <PASSWORD> \
        --bootnodes /dnsaddr/bootnode.mev-commit.xyz \
        --settlement-rpc-endpoint https://chainrpc.mev-commit.xyz \
        --nat-addr <PUBLIC_IP>
    ```

    </CodeGroup>
    
<Accordion title="❗🕵️‍♂️ Tips">
        ❗ The `keystore-path` flag expects the directory path for your keystore, not the file path itself. Example: if your keystore file is at `/Users/bob/keystore/30d2db95-keystore.json` you would use `--keystore-path /Users/bob/keystore`.
        
        ❗ If you get an `could not decrypt key with given password` error, make sure there's no other keystore files in the relevant directory.

        ❗ If you really don't want to use a keystore, `priv-key-file` can replace the `keystore-path` and `keystore-password` flags.

        ❗ The `--peer-type` flag can be used to run a `provider` or `bidder` node.

        ❗ In order to run a provider node, the machine needs to be publicly accessible. Also, the mev-commit node will have to be configured with the public IP of the node using the `nat-addr` parameter.

        See the CLI reference by running `./mev-commit --help`.

    Providers may continue to the [Registration steps](/v1.2.x/get-started/providers/registering-a-provider).

  </Step>

  <Step title="If bidder, send a bid">
    If you've started a bidder node, open a new terminal window to send a bid and receive commitments from providers by running the following command:

    ```shell ❯_ example
    curl -X POST http://localhost:13523/v1/bidder/bid \
    -d '{
        "rawTransactions": ["0x02f8db82426882010c8410433624841043362f8303425094ea593b730d745fb5fe01b6d20e6603915252c6bf87016e03ce313800b864ce0b63ce0000000000000000000000000e94804eaa3c4c5355992086647f683f6f41ef1f000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000150e0786cc000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000004e378c001a0ece6d13b20247abdc07d669c9186ee5a1ac9601db8c98a3323024ab299cb6662a01c20680efe4e0bb48a3a936b5ab27c741819f0ac567b12b34b230004b20b78a0"],
        "amount": "<amount in wei>",
        "blockNumber": <integer l1blocknumber>,
        "decayStartTimestamp": <timestamp milliseconds>,
        "decayEndTimestamp": <timestamp milliseconds>,
        "revertingTxHashes": []
    }'
    ```
    <Accordion title="Bid Structure Details">

        | Key           | Description                                           |
        |---------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
        | `txHashes`      | Array of transaction hashes as strings |
        | `amount`       | Bid amount in wei |
        | `blockNumber`  | L1 block number targeted for bid inclusion |
        | `decayStartTimestamp` | Start timestamp for bid decay (in Unix milliseconds) |
        | `decayEndTimestamp` | End timestamp for bid decay (in Unix milliseconds) |
        | `revertingTxHashes` | Array of transaction hashes as strings that can revert |
        | `rawTransactions` | Array of hexadecimal encoded raw signed transaction payloads |
        | `slashAmount` | Amount to be slashed from provider stake in case of a failed bid |

    </Accordion>

You can change the values in the fields `amount`, `blockNumber`, `decayStartTimestamp`, `decayEndTimestamp` and `revertingTxHashes` as desired. The `rawTransactions` field contains hexadecimal string of the RLP encoded raw transaction payloads, include raw transaction payloads in your bid in the atomic sequence in which they need to be placed in the block.  Only one out of `txHashes` or `rawTransactions` need to be sent in a bid.

Make sure your bid amount is sufficiently high for the commitment you're requesting, and your target L1 block number is accurate. It's up to the providers to commit to your bid, so try to ensure a commitment is feasible to your bid by its construction. Selecting a target block of n+1 where n is the current block number generally makes it easy to receive a commitment for standard bid amounts.

</Step>
</Steps>

<Check>Congrats, you just sent your first L1 preconfirmation bid! You should be receiving commitments nearly instantly.</Check>

Alternatively you can send a bid using the `txHashes` field instead of `rawTransactions` to refer to a transaction a provider has in their own environment using its hash. This method also allows you to bid on others' behalf using their transaction hashes.
```shell ❯_ example
curl -X POST http://localhost:13523/v1/bidder/bid \
-d '{
    "txHashes": ["0549fc7c57fffbdbfb2cf9d5e0de165fc68dadb5c27c42fdad0bdf506f4eacae"],
    "amount": "<amount in wei>",
    "blockNumber": <integer l1blocknumber>,
    "decayStartTimestamp": <timestamp milliseconds>,
    "decayEndTimestamp": <timestamp milliseconds>,
    "revertingTxHashes": []
}'
```

# Bidder CLI application
In order to make it simpler for users to interact with the bidder node, the team has also created a CLI application which aims to provider a simpler UX to send transactions or bids to the mev-commit network. You can check the [bidder CLI](/v1.2.x/get-started/bidders/bidder-cli) docs for more details.

# Docker Compose setup

An example docker compose setup for a bidder driver process along with mev-commit bidder node can be found [here](https://github.com/primev/preconf_bot).
