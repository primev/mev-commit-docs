This guide walks you through performing your first token swap on [Fast Swaps](https://fastprotocol.io). By the end, you will have swapped tokens on Ethereum and started earning mev rewards (Fast Miles).

<Info>
**What you need before starting:**
- A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Brave recommended)
- A wallet extension installed ([MetaMask](https://metamask.io) or [Rabby](https://rabby.io) recommended)
- ETH in your wallet (for gas fees if swapping ETH, or for the one-time token approval)
- The tokens you want to swap
</Info>

---

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Fast Swaps">
    Open your browser and navigate to **[fastprotocol.io](https://fastprotocol.io)**.

    You will see the Fast Swaps landing page with the swap interface.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect Your Wallet">
    Click the **Connect Wallet** button in the top-right corner of the page.

    A wallet selection modal will appear. Choose your wallet provider:

    - **MetaMask**
    - **Rabby**
    - **WalletConnect** (for mobile wallets or other providers)

    Your wallet extension will prompt you to approve the connection. Confirm the connection in your wallet.

    <Tip>
    Make sure your wallet is set to **Ethereum Mainnet**. For the best experience, set your Ethereum RPC to [FAST RPC](/v1.2.x/get-started/fastrpc) (`https://fastrpc.mev-commit.xyz`). This enables preconfirmations and mev rewards on all your Ethereum transactions — not just Fast Swaps. See the [FAST RPC setup guide](/v1.2.x/get-started/fastrpc#usage-for-wallets) for instructions.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select the Token You Want to Sell">
    The swap interface has two sections: **Sell** (top) and **Buy** (bottom).

    Click the token selector button in the **Sell** section. By default, it may show ETH.

    A token selector modal opens where you can:

    - **Search** by token name or symbol (e.g., "USDC" or "Uniswap")
    - **Browse popular tokens** in the top carousel (ETH, USDC, USDT, DAI, WBTC)
    - **Paste a contract address** to add any ERC-20 token not in the default list

    Select the token you want to sell. For this guide, we will use **ETH**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select the Token You Want to Buy">
    Click the token selector button in the **Buy** section and choose your desired output token. For this guide, we will select **USDC**.

    <Tip>
    You can click the **switch button** (↕) between the Sell and Buy sections to reverse the swap direction at any time.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter the Swap Amount">
    Click the amount field in the **Sell** section and type the amount you want to swap. For example, enter `0.1` to swap 0.1 ETH.

    As you type, Fast Swaps automatically:

    - **Fetches a real-time quote** via a competitive solver auction
    - **Displays the output amount** in the Buy section
    - **Shows the exchange rate** (e.g., "1 ETH = 2,450.32 USDC")
    - **Shows price impact** — the effect your trade has on the market price

    The quote refreshes every **15 seconds**. A countdown timer next to the exchange rate shows when the next refresh will occur.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review Swap Details">
    Before confirming, review the swap details displayed below the Buy section:

    | Detail | What It Means |
    | ------ | ------------- |
    | **Exchange Rate** | How much of the output token you get per unit of input token (e.g., 1 ETH = 2,450 USDC) |
    | **Price Impact** | How much your swap moves the market price. Green is negligible, yellow is moderate, red means you may want to reduce your swap size |
    | **Minimum Received** | The worst-case amount you will receive after slippage tolerance is applied |

    ### Adjust Slippage (Optional)

    Click the **settings gear icon** to open transaction settings. Here you can adjust:

    - **Slippage tolerance** — The maximum price movement you are willing to accept. Default is "Auto," which sets an appropriate value based on the token pair. You can set a custom percentage (e.g., 0.5%, 1%).
    - **Transaction deadline** — How long the swap remains valid before it expires.

    <Warning>
    Setting slippage too low may cause the swap to fail if the price moves. Setting it too high may result in a worse exchange rate. The "Auto" setting is recommended for most users.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Approve the Token (First Time Only)">
    <Info>
    **This step only applies to ERC-20 token swaps** (e.g., USDC → ETH). If you are swapping **ETH as the input token**, skip to the next step.
    </Info>

    If this is your first time swapping a particular ERC-20 token on Fast Swaps, you need to approve the **Permit2** contract to access that token. This is a one-time on-chain transaction per token.

    Click the **Approve** button. Your wallet will prompt you to confirm the approval transaction.

    <Tip>
    If you have previously approved this token for Permit2 on another app (like Uniswap), you will not need to approve it again.
    </Tip>

    Once the approval transaction confirms, the button changes to **Swap**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm the Swap">
    Click the **Swap** button to initiate the swap.

    A confirmation modal appears showing the full details of your swap:

    The confirmation modal displays:
    - **Input and output token amounts** with token icons
    - **Exchange rate** at time of execution
    - **Price impact**
    - **Minimum received** after slippage
    - **Estimated gas cost** (in ETH and USD)

    Review the details and click **Confirm Swap**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Sign in Your Wallet">
    Your wallet will prompt you to sign the transaction:

    - **For ERC-20 input tokens**: You will sign an **EIP-712 message** (a signature, not a transaction). This is gasless — you do not pay gas at this step.
    - **For ETH input**: You will sign and submit an **on-chain transaction**. This requires gas.

    Confirm the signature or transaction in your wallet.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Receive Preconfirmation">
    Within seconds of signing, your swap is **preconfirmed**. A confirmation toast appears at the bottom of the screen.

    **Preconfirmed** means Ethereum block builders on the [mev-commit](/v1.2.x/concepts/mev-commit-intro/what-is-mev-commit) network have committed to including your swap in an upcoming block. This gives you near-instant confidence that your swap will settle — no need to wait for the full block to be produced.

    This is the core Fast Swaps experience: your swap feels **instant**.

    <Accordion title="What happens after preconfirmation?">
      After the preconfirmation, your swap progresses to full on-chain confirmation in the background. The toast will update once the swap is included in a finalized Ethereum block. You do not need to wait for this — the preconfirmation is your signal that the swap is done.

      | Status | What It Means |
      | ------ | ------------- |
      | **Pending** | Your swap intent has been submitted to FAST RPC |
      | **Preconfirmed** | Ethereum block builders on mev-commit have committed to including your transaction — your swap is effectively done |
      | **Confirmed** | The swap has been included in a finalized Ethereum block. Your output tokens are fully settled on-chain |
    </Accordion>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Swap Complete">
    Once fully confirmed on-chain, the toast updates with a link to the transaction on Etherscan.

    Your output tokens are now in your wallet. The swap form resets, ready for your next trade.

    **You have earned Fast Miles for this swap.** Check your dashboard to see your accumulated miles and leaderboard ranking.

## Tips & Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="My swap is taking a long time">
  Ethereum block times are approximately 12 seconds. Most swaps are preconfirmed within seconds and fully confirmed within 1-2 blocks (12-24 seconds). If a swap takes longer:
  - Check your wallet for any pending transactions
  - The swap may be waiting for a mev-commit opted-in proposer — see [FAST RPC](/v1.2.x/get-started/fastrpc) for details
  - If the swap times out (exceeds your deadline), it will automatically cancel and your tokens will remain in your wallet
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="My swap failed — what happened?">
  Common reasons for swap failure:
  - **Slippage exceeded** — The price moved more than your slippage tolerance between quote and execution. Try increasing your slippage setting.
  - **Insufficient balance** — Make sure you have enough of the input token plus ETH for gas (if swapping ETH).
  - **Deadline expired** — The swap was not executed before the deadline. Try again with a fresh quote.
  - **Price impact too high** — For large swaps, try splitting into smaller amounts.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="I approved a token but still see the Approve button">
  The Permit2 approval may still be confirming on-chain. Wait for the approval transaction to be mined (check your wallet's activity tab), then refresh the page.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I swap any token?">
  Fast Swaps supports any ERC-20 token with on-chain liquidity on Ethereum. If a token does not appear in the default list, you can add it by pasting its contract address in the token selector search bar. Always verify the contract address from a trusted source like [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io) or [CoinGecko](https://coingecko.com).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do I need ETH for gas?">
  - **Swapping ERC-20 tokens** (e.g., USDC → ETH): After the initial one-time Permit2 approval, subsequent swaps are **gasless** — you only sign a message.
  - **Swapping ETH** (e.g., ETH → USDC): You submit an on-chain transaction and pay standard Ethereum gas fees.
  - **First-time token approval**: The one-time Permit2 approval requires a small amount of ETH for gas.
</Accordion>
