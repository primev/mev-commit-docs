Welcome to Primev! We build [mev-commit](/v1.2.x/concepts/mev-commit-intro/what-is-mev-commit), the preconfirmation protocol that makes Ethereum fast. mev-commit gives transactions near-instant finality by letting block builders commit to including them before a block is produced.

On top of mev-commit we've built **Fast Protocol** — a suite of products that put preconfirmations to work for users, developers, and AI agents:

### The Fast Protocol Ecosystem

| Product | What It Does | Link |
| ------- | ------------ | ---- |
| **Fast Swaps** | Token swaps on Ethereum with mev rewards and preconfirmed execution | [Launch](https://fastprotocol.io) |
| **FAST RPC** | Drop-in Ethereum RPC that enables preconfirmations for any wallet or dapp | [Setup Guide](/v1.2.x/get-started/fastrpc) |
| **Fastx402** | x402 payment facilitator for AI agents — sub-second USDC settlement on mainnet | [Developer Docs](/v1.2.x/developers/fastx402) |
| **mev-commit** | The preconfirmation protocol powering the ecosystem — bidders, providers, and validators | [Learn More](/v1.2.x/concepts/mev-commit-intro/what-is-mev-commit) |

### mev-commit Network Roles

mev-commit is powered by a network of bidders, providers, and validators. If you operate infrastructure on Ethereum and want to participate, visit the [quickstart guide](/v1.2.x/get-started/quickstart) or explore the resources below for your role:
