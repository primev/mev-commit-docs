The `RewardDistributor` contract is used to **receive, track, and distribute additional ETH or token rewards** earned by operators with active validators.

When operators earn extra rewards (for example, from mev-commit participation or other incentive programs), those rewards are **granted to this contract** and then **claimed by operators to their specified fee recipients**.

> Rewards are granted on-chain to the `RewardDistributor`, tracked per operator and recipient, and later claimed by operators (or their delegates) to the correct payout addresses.

## Contract Details

*   **Network**: Hoodi (Testnet)
*   **Address**: [0x69f286fc7869c30809a9695462fa79a0fd99c5bc](https://hoodi.etherscan.io/address/0x69f286fc7869c30809a9695462fa79a0fd99c5bc#writeProxyContract)

## Interacting with the Contract

The Rewards Distributor is currently live on the [Hoodi testnet](https://hoodi.etherscan.io/address/0x69f286fc7869c30809a9695462fa79a0fd99c5bc#writeProxyContract). A Mainnet deployment and a dedicated claiming UI will be available in the future.

For now, you can manage and claim rewards programmatically or by interacting directly with the contract on Etherscan.

## Claiming rewards

Rewards do not stream automatically to your wallet; you must explicitly [claim them from the contract](https://hoodi.etherscan.io/address/0x69f286fc7869c30809a9695462fa79a0fd99c5bc#writeProxyContract).

### Claim as the operator

To transfer all pending rewards to your recipients:

1.  Find the `claimRewards` function.
2.  **recipients**: Enter your recipient address(es) in bracket format.
    *   Example: `[0xYourRecipientAddress]`
3.  **tokenID**: Enter the ID of the token to claim.
    *   For **ETH**: `0`
    *   For **Tokens**: `1`
4.  Click **Write** and confirm the transaction.

## Setting reward recipients

By default, if a recipient is not set, rewards earned by a validator are granted to the validator's operator address.

### Set a global default recipient

To ensure all rewards go to a specific address (e.g. a cold wallet or a splitter contract), you should set a global operator override. This applies to all your validator keys unless specifically overridden for a key. Individual key recipient overrides can also be set.

1.  Find the `setOperatorGlobalOverride` function.
2.  **recipient**: Enter the address you want to receive the rewards.
3.  Click **Write** and confirm the transaction.
