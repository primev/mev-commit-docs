## Registering as an Operator

### Step 1: Get Whitelisted
To register, you must first be whitelisted as an operator. Please reach out to our team to request whitelisting.

### Step 2: Call `addStake`
Once whitelisted, you can register by calling:

```solidity
addStake(bytes[] blsKeys)
```

- **blsKeys**: Provide a list of your validator public keys.
- You must also provide the required ETH collateral when calling.

üí° **Formatting Note for Etherscan:** When providing `bytes[]` input on Etherscan, use the format:
```
0xkey1,0xkey2,0xkey3,...
```
(No brackets, no quotes)

### Stake Requirement
The parameter `VanillaRegistry.minStake` determines how much ETH must be staked per validator pubkey to opt-in to mev-commit:
- **Mainnet**: 1 ETH (not live yet)
- **Hoodi**: 0.0001 ETH

## Withdrawing

If you need to deregister and withdraw:
1. Call `unstake(bytes[] blsKeys)` to start the process. Validators are considered opted out during this time.
2. Wait **96 blocks** on Hoodi (the unstaking period).
3. Call `withdraw(bytes[] blsKeys)` to receive your ETH back.
