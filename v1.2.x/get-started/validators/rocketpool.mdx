This guide explains how to register Rocket Pool validators with the **Rocket Pool Minipool Registry** for mev-commit, how freezing works, and how to deregister. This Registry is only available on Hoodi testnet at the moment, with mainnet deployment coming soon.

---

## Why use this method?

Opting-in validators through the RocketMinipool Registry is ideal for validators that already exist through Rocket Pool and want to earn additional rewards.

---

## How the Registry integrates with Rocket Pool

The registry relies on Rocket Pool’s contracts to check for each validator’s associated minipool and determine the **authorized operators**. The registry itself does not remap keys to minipools and operators; Rocket Pool contract data is checked at the time of the relevant call.

## Registering validators

### Registering using a withdrawal address

Registration can currently be done on Hoodi etherscan using the "Write as Proxy" tab on the [RocketMinipoolRegistry contract](https://hoodi.etherscan.io/address/0xbe5a803a7b68f442eff1953c672a3499779680b0#writeProxyContract) (address {HoodiRocketMinipoolRegistryAddress}). Mainnet deployment is planned in the near future.


Call:
```solidity
registerValidators(bytes[] valPubKeys)
```

Requirements per key:
- The pubkey must be associated with an **active Rocket Pool minipool**.
- The validator must not already be registered.
- The caller must be the **withdrawal address** for that minipool.

**Etherscan input tip (bytes[]):**
```
0xkey1, 0xkey2, 0xkey3, ...
```
No brackets, no quotes.

### Registering using a signature from your node address

Users can alternatively register by authorizing an executor to register using a signature from their node address, signed through Smart Node. Frontend integration for signature generation is coming soon.

> **⚠️ Caution: Do not use your node address in a web browser**
>
> For node security, it is best practice to avoid putting <strong>node address keys</strong> into web browsers.
> When registering via a browser, use your <strong>withdrawal address</strong> instead, or perform the action locally via so keys never touch a website.


## Freezing & unfreezing

- **Freeze:** The **freeze oracle** can call `freeze(bytes[] valPubKeys)` for validators that violate protocol rules. Frozen validators are considered opted out.
- **Unfreeze:** Anyone can call `unfreeze(bytes[] valPubKeys)` and pay `unfreezeFee * numberOfKeys`. The current fee and receiver can be checked on-chain. The owner can also override with `ownerUnfreeze(bytes[] valPubKeys)`.

---

## Deregistration

Deregistration is a two-step process:
- Call `requestValidatorDeregistration(bytes[] valPubKeys)` to start the timer.
- After `deregistrationPeriod` has passed, call `deregisterValidators(bytes[] valPubKeys)` to complete it. Validators must not be frozen.

Helper: `getEligibleTimeForDeregistration(bytes pubkey)` returns the timestamp when a validator can be deregistered. A value of 0 indicates that no deregistration request has been made for the key.

## Relay Filtering

Opting in on **mainnet** [requires agreement to only use opted-in relays](https://docs.primev.xyz/v1.1.0/get-started/validators/validator-guide#requirements), but these requirements do not exist on Hoodi at this time.
