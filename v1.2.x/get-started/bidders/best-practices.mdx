# Bidder Best Practices

This guide outlines the best practices for bidders to optimize their interactions with the mev-commit network and maximize their utility.

## Understanding Commitments

In the mev-commit network, commitments are essential to the bidding process. You receive two types of commitments: **Credible** and **General**.

### Credible Commitments
* **Definition:** Guarantees made by network participants who have direct control over fulfilling your bid.
* **Assurance:** These offer the highest level of assurance because the proposer has opted in to mev-commit.
* **Automation:** [Querying for Proposers](/v1.2.x/get-started/providers/querying-for-proposers) is available by default and will notify you when commitments become credible.

### General Commitments
* **Definition:** Promises made by network participants with a lower level of assurance compared to credible commitments.
* **Reliability:** These can approach the reliability of credible commitments when aggregated across multiple providers (e.g., all block builders for a mev-boost-enabled validator).
* **Mechanism:** The proposer hasn't opted in yet, but a committing block builder may still win the auction and deliver the commitment.
* **Resources:** You can obtain the list of all registered providers as described [here](/v1.2.x/get-started/providers/registering-as-a-provider).

## Submitting Bundles

To include transaction bundles, submit them in the exact atomic sequence they appear. You can submit bundles using two methods:

1. **Transaction Payloads (Recommended):** More efficient as it eliminates payload lookups, allowing providers to return commitments faster.
2. **Transaction Hashes:** Useful if providers already have the transactions via RPC or mempool. *Note: Not all providers support this.*

Learn more about the detailed **[bid structure here](/v1.2.x/concepts/bids)**.

### Option 1: Transaction Payload
Include the raw payloads in the atomic sequence required for the block.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:13523/v1/bidder/bid \
-d '{
    "rawTransactions": ["0x02f8..."],
    "amount": "<amount in wei>",
    "blockNumber": <integer>,
    "decayStartTimestamp": <timestamp>,
    "decayEndTimestamp": <timestamp>,
    "revertingTxHashes": ["7ca1..."]
}'
```
### Option 2: Transaction Hash ##
Use this for transactions already available in the public mempool or provider RPCs.
```curl -X POST http://localhost:13523/v1/bidder/bid \
-d '{
    "txHashes": ["0549..."],
    "amount": "<amount in wei>",
    "blockNumber": <integer>,
    "decayStartTimestamp": <timestamp>,
    "decayEndTimestamp": <timestamp>,
    "revertingTxHashes": ["2214..."]
}'
```

## Bid Parameters

**Bid Amount**: Set this to the **total amount** the bidder is willing to pay for the bundle. 
 Gas used by transactions does **not** affect the final amount paid.

**Bid Decay**: Use `decayStartTimestamp` and `decayEndTimestamp` to control price sensitivity. More details can be found [here](https://docs.primev.xyz/v1.2.x/concepts/bids/bid-structure#details-on-decay-parameters).

**Bid Options**: Used to set positional constraints on transactions. Learn more about the [options here](https://github.com/primev/mev-commit-docs/blob/main/v1.2.x/concepts/bids/bid-structure#details-on-bidOptions).

## Troubleshooting
If you are not receiving commitments instantly:

 1.  **Check Parameters**: Ensure your bid is high enough for the requested commitment.

2. **Connectivity**: Check that you are connected to providers via the [topology endpoint](https://docs.primev.xyz/v1.2.x/get-started/bidders/bidder-node-commands#health).

3. **Health Check**: Ensure you are receiving events via the [health endpoint](https://docs.primev.xyz/v1.2.x/get-started/bidders/bidder-node-commands#health)/.

## Bidder Depositing & Automation
Bidders must bridge ETH to the mev-commit chain and deposit it toward providers. As bids are settled, you must "top up" your deposits.

### Deposit Manager
To automate this, enable the **Deposit Manager**:

* **Target Deposit**: Set the maximum cumulative amount of ETH you would bid to a provider for a single L1 block.

* **Auto Top-up**: The relevant deposit will be automatically restored to the target value during settlement.
