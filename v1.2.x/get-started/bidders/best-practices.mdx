# Bidder Best Practices

This guide outlines the best practices for bidders to optimize their interactions with the mev-commit network and maximize their utility.

## Understanding Commitments

In the mev-commit network, you receive two types of commitments during the bidding process: **Credible** and **General**.

* **Credible**: Guarantees with direct proposer opt-in.

* **General**: Promises with a lower level of assurance.


Registered providers are described in the [Providers Registry list](https://providers-list).

## Submitting Bundles

To include transaction bundles, submit them in the exact atomic sequence they appear. You can **submit bundles** using two methods:

1. **Transaction Payloads (Recommended):** More efficient as it eliminates payload lookups, allowing providers to return commitments faster.
2. **Transaction Hashes:** Useful if providers already have the transactions via RPC or mempool. *Note: Not all providers support this.*

### Option 1: Transaction Payload
Include the raw payloads in the atomic sequence required for the block.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:13523/v1/bidder/bid \
-d '{
    "rawTransactions": ["0x02f8..."],
    "amount": "<amount in wei>",
    "blockNumber": <integer>,
    "decayStartTimestamp": <timestamp>,
    "decayEndTimestamp": <timestamp>,
    "revertingTxHashes": ["7ca1..."]
}'
```
### Option 2: Transaction Hash ##
Use this for transactions already available in the public mempool.
```bashcurl -X POST http://localhost:13523/v1/bidder/bid \
-d '{
    "txHashes": ["0549..."],
    "amount": "<amount in wei>",
    "blockNumber": <integer>,
    "decayStartTimestamp": <timestamp>,
    "decayEndTimestamp": <timestamp>,
    "revertingTxHashes": ["2214..."]
}'
```
### **Bid Parameters** ##
**Bid Amount**: Set this to the total amount you are willing to pay for the bundle. 
The gas used does not affect the final amount paid.

**Bid Decay**: Use `decayStartTimestamp` and `decayEndTimestamp` to control 
the price sensitivity of the preconfirmation. [Learn how to control](https://docs.primev.xyz/v1.2.x/concepts/bids/bid-structure#details-on-decay-parameters).

**Bid Options**: Set positional constraints on transactions within the block. [Positional constraints options ](https://github.com/andesign31/mev-commit-docs/blob/main/v1.2.x/concepts/bids/bid-structure#details-on-bidOptions).

## Bidder Depositing & Automation ##
Bidders must bridge ETH to the mev-commit chain and deposit it toward providers.

**Deposit Manager** 

To avoid manual "top-ups", enable the **Deposit Manager**:

Target Deposit: Set a desired amount for a specific provider.

**Auto Top-up**: The system automatically restores the target value during settlement.

**Strategy**: Set target deposits to the maximum cumulative ETH you intend to bid for a single L1 block.

## Troubleshooting
If you are not receiving commitments:

**Check Parameters**: Ensure your bid amount is competitive for the requested commitment.

**Verify Topology**: Use the `/topology` endpoint to check provider connections.

**Health Check**: Use the `/health` endpoint to ensure you are receiving mev-commit events.
