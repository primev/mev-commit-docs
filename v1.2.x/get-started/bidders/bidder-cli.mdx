# Bidder CLI

The `bidder-cli` is a tool designed to provide a better User Experience (UX) for users sending raw transactions or bids on existing transactions to the mev-commit network.

<>
You can download the latest version of the tool from the [official releases page](https://github.com/primev/mev-commit/releases/latest).


## General Usage

The basic structure for interacting with the gRPC bidder server is:

```bash
bidder-cli [global options] command [command options]
``` 
## Global Commands
* `send-tx`: Used to create and sign a new L1 transaction and send it to the network.

* `send-tx-hash`: Used to send bids for transactions already present in the mempool.

* `help`: Shows the full list of commands and options.

## Sending Transactions (`send-tx`)
This command allows you to create a simple transfer transaction on the L1 chain and submit it directly to mev-commit.

**Security**: You must provide the private key of the account to sign the transaction. Never share this key or include it in public scripts.

**Example Usage**
```` 
./bidder-cli send-tx \
  --from <PRIVATE_KEY> \
  --to <DESTINATION_ADDRESS> \
  --value <AMOUNT_IN_WEI> \
  --bid-amount <BID_IN_WEI> \
  --rpc-url localhost:13524
  ```` 
  **Key Options**

* `--rpc-url`: The URL for the gRPC server (default is `localhost:13524`).

* `--block-number`: Target block for the bid. If omitted, the next block is used.

* `--decay-duration`: The time window for the bid amount to decay (default: 10m).
* `--l1-rpc-url`: Used to fetch the account nonce. Default: `https://ethereum-hoodi-rpc.publicnode.com`.
---
## Bidding by Transaction Hash (`send-tx-hash`)
Use this command to bid on transactions that are already in the public mempool or block-builder mempools.

**Example Usage**
````
./bidder-cli send-tx-hash \
  --tx-hashes <HASH_1> \
  --tx-hashes <HASH_2> \
  --bid-amount <AMOUNT> \
  --rpc-url localhost:13524
````
Users can provide multiple --`tx-hashes` flags to bid on several transactions simultaneously. 

Important Considerations
Gossip Latency: There is a possibility that a transaction is not gossiped to the provider's infrastructure in time. For better results, consider using the Provider's RPC for submission.

Reverting Hashes: You can specify transactions that should be considered "reverting" using the --reverting-tx-hashes flag.
