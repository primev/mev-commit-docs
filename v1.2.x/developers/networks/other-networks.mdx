mev-commit is designed to be network-agnostic. While it currently operates on Ethereum mainnet and testnet, the protocol can be extended to support preconfirmations on any network where execution service providers — whether validators, miners, sequencers, or other block producers — are willing to issue commitments against future block space.

## How It Works

When mev-commit is deployed for a new network, Primev spins up a **dedicated mev-commit network instance** for that ecosystem. This includes:

- **Custom bootnode** — A dedicated bootnode endpoint is provisioned for the target network, allowing providers and bidders to discover peers within the correct mev-commit network instance.
- **Provider registration** — The network's execution service providers (validators, sequencers, etc.) register as mev-commit providers and run provider nodes connected to the custom bootnode.
- **Bidder access** — Bidders who want preconfirmations on the target network connect their bidder nodes to the same custom bootnode.
- **Oracle and settlement** — A network-specific oracle is configured to verify commitment fulfillment against the target network's block production.
- **FastRPC endpoint** — A [FastRPC](/v1.2.x/get-started/fastrpc) instance can be stood up for the network, giving users a single RPC endpoint that automatically wraps transactions with preconfirmation bids.

Each network instance operates independently, so providers and bidders should run separate mev-commit nodes per network they participate in.

## For Execution Service Providers

If you are a validator, sequencer, miner, or other block producer on a network and want to bring mev-commit preconfirmations to your ecosystem:

1. **Reach out to the Primev team** — Contact us to discuss your network's architecture and requirements. We will work with you to configure a custom mev-commit instance.
2. **Run a provider node** — Once the instance is provisioned, you will run a mev-commit provider node alongside your existing infrastructure, pointed at the custom bootnode for your network.
3. **Register as a provider** — Stake and register on the provider registry so bidders can discover and interact with you.
4. **Process bids and issue commitments** — Receive bids from bidders in your network's mev-commit instance and issue cryptographic commitments for execution.

## For Bidders

If you want preconfirmations on a supported network:

1. **Deploy a bidder node** — Run a mev-commit bidder node configured with the custom bootnode endpoint for the target network.
2. **Fund your bidder account** — Deposit funds into the bidder registry to back your bids.
3. **Submit bids** — Send bids specifying the transactions you want preconfirmed. Providers on the target network will issue commitments.

We recommend running a **separate bidder node** for each network you participate in.

## What Primev Provisions
