Bridging between Holesky and the mev-commit chain is a crucial step for users engaging with cross-chain functionalities. This guide outlines the process using the CLI tool. A user-friendly frontend with wallet integrations is under development and will be launched shortly.

### Testing the Bridge CLI

For a quick test using a pre-funded account on Holesky, execute the following one-liner:

```shell
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/primev/scripts/v0.1.0/bridge.sh | bash
```

This command simplifies the bridging process, allowing you to quickly experience cross-chain operations.

### Setting Up for Bridging

1. **Clone and Build:**

Start by cloning the [mev-commit-bridge](https://github.com/primev/mev-commit-bridge) and build the user CLI for your machine from the `standard/bridge-v1` directory:

```shell
make user_cli
```

Or use a pre-built binary from the `releases` tab in [mev-commit-bridge](https://github.com/primev/mev-commit-bridge/releases).

2. **Configure Environment Variables:**

Set the necessary environment variables for a cross-chain transfer. Replace the values below with your own details:

```shell
export PRIVATE_KEY="0xe82a054e06f89598485134b4f2ce8a612ce7f7f7e14e650f9f20b30efddd0e57"
export LOG_LEVEL="debug"
export L1_RPC_URL="https://ethereum-holesky.publicnode.com"
export SETTLEMENT_RPC_URL="https://chainrpc.testnet.mev-commit.xyz"
export L1_CHAIN_ID="17000"
export SETTLEMENT_CHAIN_ID="17864"
export L1_CONTRACT_ADDR="0xceff0a364f63f621ff6a8b5ce56569ec6f3c6220"
export SETTLEMENT_CONTRACT_ADDR="0xf60f8e762a3fe90fd4d8c005872b6f6e12eda8ca"
```

Note the above contract addresses are correct for the current deployment of the mev-commit testnet. Constant ENS addresses will be available soon.

3. **Bridging to mev-commit Chain:**

To bridge ether from Holesky to the mev-commit chain, specify the amount in wei and the destination address:

```shell
./bin/user_cli bridge-to-settlement --amount $AMOUNT_IN_WEI --dest-addr $DEST_ADDR
```

Ensure your `PRIVATE_KEY` corresponds to a funded account on Holesky.

4. **Bridging Back to Holesky:**

To return ether to Holesky from the mev-commit chain, use:

```shell
./bin/user_cli bridge-to-l1 --amount $AMOUNT_IN_WEI --dest-addr $DEST_ADDR
```

Here, the`PRIVATE_KEY` should match an account with funds on the mev-commit chain.
