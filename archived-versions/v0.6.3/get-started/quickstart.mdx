  <Step title="Launch mev-commit Bidder Node">
            ```bash ‚ùØ_ bidder
         curl -L -o launchmevcommit launch.mev-commit.xyz; chmod +x launchmevcommit; ./launchmevcommit --node-type bidder
        ```
<Accordion title="ü§î What does the script do?">

    ## Script Overview

    This script automates the setup and initialization of your Primev node, catering to both bidder and provider roles. Below is a detailed breakdown of the script's operations:

    ### 1. Initialization
    - Sets up essential variables like the RPC URL (`https://chainrpc.testnet.mev-commit.xyz) for network communication and the node type (either `bidder` or `provider`).
    - Establishes the root directory (`$HOME/.mev-commit`) where the mev-commit node will be installed.

    ### 2. Download
    - Fetches the appropriate mev-commit binary for your system from the [Primev GitHub releases page](https://github.com/primev/mev-commit/releases/latest), considering your operating system and architecture.

    ### 3. Installation
    - Extracts the downloaded binary into the specified root directory, ensuring all necessary executables are correctly placed for the node's operation.

    ### 4. Configuration
    - Initializes the mev-commit node with your specified settings, including the node type and the RPC endpoint, along with necessary contract addresses for the node's functionality.

    ### 5. Wallet Setup
    - Generates a new private key and wallet address for your node.

    ### 6. Node Startup
    - Launches the mev-commit node in the background tailored to the specified role, enabling it to begin its operations within the Primev network.

    ### 7. Cleanup
    - Includes a cleanup function to ensure the node is properly shut down when the script exits, preventing any residual processes.

  <Step title="Fund Your Account">
    To fund your account, please visit our [Testnet Faucet](/v0.6.3/get-started/faucet). Details about the account address will be displayed after running the command above.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Send a Bid">
    Open a new terminal window to send a bid and receive commitments from providers. Run the following command:

```shell ‚ùØ_ example
curl -X POST http://localhost:13523/v1/bidder/bid \
-d '{
    "txHashes": ["0549fc7c57fffbdbfb2cf9d5e0de165fc68dadb5c27c42fdad0bdf506f4eacae"],
    "amount": "<amount in wei>",
    "blockNumber": <integer l1blocknumber>,
    "decayStartTimestamp": <timestamp milliseconds>,
    "decayEndTimestamp": <timestamp milliseconds>,
    "revertingTxHashes": []
}'
```
    <Accordion title="Bid Structure Details">

        | Key           | Description                                           |
        |---------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
        | `txHashes`      | Array of transaction hashes as strings |
        | `amount`       | Bid amount in wei |
        | `blockNumber`  | L1 block number targeted for bid inclusion |
        | `decayStartTimestamp` | Start timestamp for bid decay (in Unix milliseconds) |
        | `decayEndTimestamp` | End timestamp for bid decay (in Unix milliseconds) |
        | `revertingTxHashes` | Array of transaction hashes as strings that can revert |
        | `rawTransactions` | Array of hexadecimal encoded raw signed transaction payloads |

    </Accordion>

You can change the values in the fields `txHashes`, `amount`, `blockNumber`, `decayStartTimestamp`, `decayEndTimestamp` and `revertingTxHashes` as desired.

Make sure your bid amount is sufficiently high for the commitment you're requesting, and your target L1 block number is accurate. It's up to the providers to commit to your bid, so try to ensure a commitment is feasible to your bid by its construction. Selecting a target block of n+1 where n is the current block number generally makes it easy to receive a commitment for standard bid amounts.

We recommend sending the raw transaction payloads in the bid. The `rawTransactions` field contains hexadecimal string of the RLP encoded raw transaction payloads. Only one out of `txHashes` or `rawTransactions` need to be sent in a bid.

```shell ‚ùØ_ example
curl -X POST http://localhost:13523/v1/bidder/bid \
-d '{
    "rawTransactions": ["0x02f8db82426882010c8410433624841043362f8303425094ea593b730d745fb5fe01b6d20e6603915252c6bf87016e03ce313800b864ce0b63ce0000000000000000000000000e94804eaa3c4c5355992086647f683f6f41ef1f000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000150e0786cc000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000004e378c001a0ece6d13b20247abdc07d669c9186ee5a1ac9601db8c98a3323024ab299cb6662a01c20680efe4e0bb48a3a936b5ab27c741819f0ac567b12b34b230004b20b78a0"],
    "amount": "<amount in wei>",
    "blockNumber": <integer l1blocknumber>,
    "decayStartTimestamp": <timestamp milliseconds>,
    "decayEndTimestamp": <timestamp milliseconds>,
    "revertingTxHashes": []
}'
