## Background

EIP-4844 introduced blob-carrying transactions to Ethereum, providing a more cost-effective data availability solution for Layer 2 rollups. Blobs are ~125 KB data containers using KZG commitments, stored off-chain for approximately 18 days. The blob space operates on a separate fee market from regular gas, using a blob base fee that adjusts based on demand, similar to EIP-1559.

## The Problem

The fixed (large) size of blobs creates unique challenges:
- Limited flexibility compared to regular transactions
- Potential for extreme price volatility
- Uncertainty in inclusion for time-sensitive L2 operations
- Vulnerability to censorship by block builders

These factors can lead to suboptimal mev extraction opportunities and unpredictable L2 state updates.

## Using a Blob Preconfirmation

Blob preconfirmations on mev-commit provide a way to secure blob inclusion in advance, which reduces uncertainty and volatility in the blob market. Hereâ€™s how:

<Steps>
        <Step title="Bid Preparation and Submission">

Bidders create a blob transaction (containing up to 6 blobs) and submit a bid on mev-commit including:
- Transaction hash
- Target slot (typically N+1)
- Bid amount
- Bid Evaluation

Preconf providers analyze bids considering things like:
- Bid amount
- Potential impact on block propagation
- Available space in the target block
- Possible mev opportunities within the blob data

</Step>
<Step title="Commitment Issuance">

If a bid is accepted, the provider generates a commitment. This commitment is sent back to the bidder, typically within milliseconds

</Step>
<Step title="Execution">

The bidder's node automatically verifies the received commitment, and the blob is now guaranteed to be included in the specified block as per the preconfirmation terms

</Step>
</Steps>
## Benefits

Blob preconfirmations offer significant advantages for mev searchers, rollups themselves, and the broader Ethereum ecosystem, particularly:
- By providing advanced knowledge of future blob content, preconfirmations enable mev searchers to develop more sophisticated cross-domain strategies that span multiple blocks, both between L2s and between L2s and L1.
- The reduced uncertainty from preconfirmations allows for tighter latency optimization in mev extraction. Searchers can more accurately time their strategies because they know when specific blobs will be included.
- With guaranteed inclusion, Layer-2 sequencers can adopt more aggressive strategies, which in turn  may lead to new forms of mev specific to L2 systems.
- Preconfirmations allow for collaborative building of type3 blockspace, which creates a pricing basis for a robust futures market. Such a market offers more reliable inclusion and price stability for rollups and other blob posters.
- These benefits collectively contribute to a more efficient, predictable, and opportunity-rich environment for mev extraction, while also supporting the overall stability and functionality of Layer-2s.
