## Why register as a mev-commit AVS operator? 

Validator organizations may wish to register an operator entity with the mev-commit AVS in order to facilitate bulk validator opt-in to mev-commit via restaking.

Operators currently serve the purpose of (optionally) being able to register validators with mev-commit, if the relevant validator(s) are natively restaked with Eigenlayer and delegated to the operator. Future iterations of the mev-commit AVS may assign Operators further tasks, such as decentralized oracle attestations.

The mev-commit AVS dashboard can be found at https://holesky.eigenlayer.xyz/avs/0xcae2d8c15c603683c862f57850ef8ae550280432.

## Prerequisites

To register with the mev-commit AVS, operators must first register their Ethereum account with the Eigenlayer core contracts on Holesky.

You can follow Eigenlayer's instructions for operator account registration [here](https://docs.eigenlayer.xyz/eigenlayer/operator-guides/operator-installation).

You will need an `operator.yml` file to perform registration actions with the mev-commit AVS. This file is created as part of registering as an operator with the EigenLayer CLI, and does not need to be modified. See [Eigenlayer reference operator.yml](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-cli/blob/master/pkg/operator/config/operator-config-example.yaml).

All interactions are enabled by the [operator CLI for the mev-commit AVS](https://github.com/primev/eigen-operator-cli). To get started, head over to the [releases page](https://github.com/primev/eigen-operator-cli/releases) and download a binary for your OS from the latest release. Alternatively you can build from source code included in the repo.

## Mev-commit AVS Registration

Mev-commit AVS registration is simple for Operators and only requires posting a signature over some AVS related metadata.

Registration signals to EigenLayer that you'd like to be an operator for the mev-commit AVS.

To register for the Holesky mev-commit AVS use a command similar to:

```bash
mev-commit-operator-cli register \
    --operator-config $PATH_TO_OPERATOR_YML \
    --avs-address "0xcae2d8c15c603683c862f57850ef8ae550280432" \
    --boost-gas-params false \
    --keystore-password $PASSWORD
```

The keystore password can be provided as an option, otherwise the CLI will prompt for it.

The registration command will query data from the AVS contracts and sign over a hash of the following:

1. Operator address
2. Mev-commit AVS address
3. Unique salt
4. 1 hour expiry

Then a registration transaction is sent on behalf of the operator account with the signed hash to be validated on-chain.

A full list of command options can be found by running `mev-commit-operator-cli register --help`.

## Deregistration

To deregister an operator from the mev-commit AVS, the operator account must first request deregistration:

```bash
mev-commit-operator-cli request-deregistration [command options]
```

Then after waiting for the deregistration period to pass, the operator can deregister:

```bash
mev-commit-operator-cli deregister [command options]
```

Both these commands accept the same options as the registration command.
