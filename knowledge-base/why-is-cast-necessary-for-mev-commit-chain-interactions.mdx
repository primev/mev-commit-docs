## What is cast?

The cli tool `cast` is used in the mev-commit ecosystem, designed to simplify user interactions with the blockchain.
It serves various purposes, from executing transactions and querying data to deploying smart contracts, making blockchain interactions more accessible and user-friendly.

## EVM Compatibility

While `cast` is highlighted for its ease of use and efficiency, the mev-commit chain's compatibility with the
Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) broadens the scope for user interaction. This EVM compatibility means users are
not limited to `cast`; they can leverage any EVM-compatible tools for their blockchain activities.
To use these tools, it's essential to configure the RPC URL appropriately to ensure connectivity with the mev-commit chain.

This flexibility underscores the mev-commit chain's user-centric approach, allowing for a choice in interaction methods
to suit diverse user preferences and technical backgrounds. Whether through `cast` or other EVM-compatible tools, the key
is seamless and effective interaction with the mev-commit chain.
