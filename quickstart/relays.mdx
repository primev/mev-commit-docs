Relays play an important role in the mev-commit ecosystem to uphold validator commitments. Validators are passively opting in to the network, and configuring their mev-boost relays to the ones that have opted in to mev-commit.

Opting into mev-commit as a relay means that you sign up to deliver mev-boost bids only from builder addresses that have registered with mev-commit. This is necessary as it acts as a sybil resistance mechanism, disallowing block builders from making commitments but building a block under a different builder key that mev-commit would not be able to penalize. In this context, 'filtering' refers to the relay's role in screening and validating builder addresses, ensuring that only those registered with mev-commit are allowed to submit bids, following the protocol.

Information about the providers (entities like builders who commit on our network) is stored in our provider registry. You can interact with the registry at the contract address at {ProviderRegistryAddress}.

  <Accordion title="How to retrieve all connected providers">
    You can retrieve all connected providers using the following script:

    ```javascript
    // Import the ethers library
    const ethers = require("ethers");

    // Define the provider using the RPC URL
    const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider("https://chainrpc.testnet.mev-commit.xyz/");

    // Define the contract address and ABI
    const providerRegistryAddress = "0x4FC9b98e1A0Ff10de4c2cf294656854F1d5B207D";
    const abi = [
        "event ProviderRegistered(address indexed provider, uint256 stakedAmount)"
    ];

    // Create a new contract instance
    const contract = new ethers.Contract(providerRegistryAddress, abi, provider);

    // Function to retrieve the list of registered providers
    async function getRegisteredProviders() {
        // Create a filter for the ProviderRegistered event
        const filter = contract.filters.ProviderRegistered();

        // Query the contract for the ProviderRegistered events
        const events = await contract.queryFilter(filter);

        // Map the events to get the list of provider addresses
        const providers = events.map(event => event.args.provider);

        return providers;
    }

    // Call the function and log the result
    getRegisteredProviders().then(providers => {
        console.log("Registered Providers:", providers);
    }).catch(error => {
        console.error("Error:", error);
    });
    ```

  <Accordion title="Expected Output">
    The output will be a list of addresses that have registered with mev-commit.

Relays need to look out for mev-commit opted-in proposer addresses, and only deliver block builder bids from builder addresses that are registered with mev-commit when it's that proposer's turn. See [Querying for Proposers](/get-started/providers/Querying-for-proposers) to see how you can check whether an upcoming proposer is opted in to mev-commit or not.

Once you've configured your relay to deliver blocks with mev-commit commitments, create a PR to this [docs repo](https://github.com/primev/mev-commit-docs/blob/main/get-started/validators.mdx) to add your relay to the supporting relays list. This will let validators know that they can add your relay as they opt-in to mev-commit. You should also let the Primev team know so we can further engage with validators to make sure they use your relay as well.
