## Interacting with the Bidder Node

<Note>Ensure you have completed the [Quickstart](/get-started/quickstart) step in a separate terminal. This will set up your environment and place your key in the `$HOME/.mev-commit` directory, along with running the required bidder node.</Note>

Now that you've made sure we have a bidder node running, we can interact with it using the following commands:

```shell ❯_ terminal
cd $HOME/.mev-commit;
export KEY=$(cat key);
export ADDRESS=$(cast wallet address --private-key 0x$(cat key))
```

## Getting Deposit

To get the current deposit balance in the contract for the current [window](/concepts/bids/bidder-deposit):

```shell ❯_ terminal
curl -s http://localhost:13523/v1/bidder/get_deposit
```

To get the current deposit balance in the contract for a specific [window](/concepts/bids/bidder-deposit):

```shell ❯_ terminal
curl -s http://localhost:13523/v1/bidder/get_deposit?windowNumber=1
```

<Tip>Deposit represents the funds in the bidder's account that can be used to submit bids on the mev-commit p2p-network and settled on-chain.</Tip>

## Withdraw Deposited Funds

This command will allow you to withdraw funds from the specific [window](/concepts/bids/bidder-deposit). 
Window number is the number where the bidder deposited funds.

```shell ❯_ terminal
cast send 0x7ffa86fF89489Bca72Fec2a978e33f9870B2Bd25 "withdrawBidderAmountFromWindow(address,uint256)" $ADDRESS <window_number> \
--rpc-url https://chainrpc.testnet.mev-commit.xyz --private-key $KEY
```

## Checking the Balance of your Wallet

This command will allow you to check your current wallet balance on mev-commit chain:

```shell ❯_ terminal
cast b $ADDRESS --rpc-url https://chainrpc.testnet.mev-commit.xyz
```

## Check Total Value Locked in Contracts

```shell ❯_ terminal
python3 -c "print($(cast b 0x7ffa86fF89489Bca72Fec2a978e33f9870B2Bd25 \
--rpc-url https://chainrpc.testnet.mev-commit.xyz) + $(cast b 0x4FC9b98e1A0Ff10de4c2cf294656854F1d5B207D \
--rpc-url https://chainrpc.testnet.mev-commit.xyz))"
```

## Topology

```shell ❯_ terminal
curl http://localhost:13523/topology
```
