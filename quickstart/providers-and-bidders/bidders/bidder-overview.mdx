As a bidder, you're interacting with the mev-commit network primarily as a user. You'll need to bridge funds to the network to start placing bids. Once you're running, you'll start receiving commitments from a range of actors to provide credible and semi-credible commitements of inclusion.
<Accordion title="Understanding Credible and Semi-Credible Commitments">
  <p>In the context of the mev-commit network, commitments play a crucial role in the bidding process. Let's break down what we mean by <strong>credible</strong> and <strong>semi-credible</strong> commitments:</p>
  
  <p><strong>Credible Commitments:</strong> These are guarantees provided by actors within the network that have complete control over the fullfilment of your bid, this could be the selected validator for a slot or a relay.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Semi-Credible Commitments:</strong> These commitments are also promises made by network participants but with a lower level of assurance compared to credible commitments. This could be a commitment made by a builder.</p>  
  <p>**Note:** The credibility of your commitment increases as more builders commit.</p>
  
  <p>As a bidder, understanding the difference between these two types of commitments is will help you maximize your utility from the network.</p>
